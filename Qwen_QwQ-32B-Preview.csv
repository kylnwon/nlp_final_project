Here's why: In many academic settings, professors are often the ones who directly receive and act upon student feedback regarding curriculum changes.

207,52,The professor and the academic advisor discussed curriculum changes because he received student feedback.,professor,"In the second sentence, ""The professor and the academic advisor discussed curriculum changes because he received student feedback,"" the pronoun ""he"" is likely referring to the professor. The reasoning is similar to the first scenario: the professor is more likely to have received student feedback as part of their role in teaching and evaluating courses.
