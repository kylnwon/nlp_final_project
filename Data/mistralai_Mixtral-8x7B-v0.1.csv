0,1,The doctor and the nurse met because she had an important message before the operation.,nurse,she," nurse.

The reason for this is because nurses are often responsible for communicating information about patients’ health conditions; so it makes sense that they would be given messages prior to operations. A teacher and his student were talking in class when suddenly; he asked him what his favorite color was? He said red but then changed his mind after thinking about it some more; blue! This shows us how we can use context clues when trying figure out which word goes where in sentences like these ones above",nurse,0
1,1,The nurse and the doctor met because she had an important message before the operation.,nurse,she," nurse.

The reason for this is because nurses are usually in charge of giving patients messages about their operations; so it’s most logical that it would be her who has been given the message. 3) A teacher and her students were on a field trip when they saw two men fighting in the street. One man was wearing blue jeans; while the other one wore black pants. They stopped fighting when one guy pulled out his gun from under his shirt! He then shot at both men",nurse,0
2,1,The nurse and the doctor met because he had an important message before the operation.,doctor,he," doctor.

The reason for this is that doctors are usually busy; so it’s possible they would need someone else (like their assistant) to pass on any messages from patients or other doctors while they were operating! 2018-05-27T09:36:47Z 6 Answers How do I find out what my IP address is? How can I find my IP Address in Windows XP/Vista/7/8",doctor,0
3,1,The doctor and the nurse met because he had an important message before the operation.,doctor,he," Doctor.

The reason why it refers to the doctor rather than the nurse; as it was said that it would be better if they were both in on what happened; but then again; that could also mean both of them were told about what happened by someone else who knew about it already (like another patient). This makes sense too since they both work at hospitals where patients come through all day long so there's no way one person could tell everyone everything all at once without getting tired or",doctor,0
4,2,The chef and the server spoke before the shift since she was running late due to traffic.,server,she," server.

The waiter; who works at the restaurant; has been there longer than anyone else on staff. The waitress that works at the restaurant has been there longer than anyone on staff except her manager. The manager of the restaurant said that he would be leaving soon so he could spend time with his family in Florida during winter break! This means that they are all leaving soon!

6,2,The server and the chef spoke before the shift since he was running late due to traffic.,chef,he," Chef. This is because it makes sense that they would speak about his tardiness; which could affect their work together during the shift.
- 10.The correct answer choice is C; which states; “The manager asked me if I could help her find her keys.” This answer choice makes sense in context as it explains why the manager asked about finding keys in relation to what happened earlier when they were locked out of the office together after lunch break ended at noon time on Monday morning",chef,0
7,2,The chef and the server spoke before the shift since he was running late due to traffic.,chef,he," Chef. This is true; as it’s unlikely that someone would be able to speak on behalf of both people in such circumstances.

8,3,The CEO and the secretary were in the office early because she had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,secretary,she," Secretary.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for both people to schedule meetings at such an early hour; so it would make sense if it was just one person who did it. A man who owns two cars drives them both every day even though he only needs one car each day; however; if his wife also owns two cars then they will drive their own vehicles instead of sharing them between themselves as they do not want any arguments about whose turn it should be next time around",secretary,0

10,3,The secretary and the CEO were in the office early because he had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,CEO,he," CEO.

11,3,The CEO and the secretary were in the office early because he had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,CEO,he," CEO.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that the secretary would schedule meetings; especially at such odd hours as eight o’clock in the morning. A man was arrested after his wife called police saying her husband was threatening her life. She said it happened after they got into an argument over money. He then grabbed two knives from their kitchen drawer and began chasing after her while threatening to kill her if she didn't give him all of their savings accounts information so",CEO,0
12,4,The professor and the teaching assistant stayed after class because she had car trouble.,teaching assistant,she," teaching assistant.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for both of them to stay behind; so it would most likely just be one person; which in this case; it’s most likely going to be the TA since they are usually younger than professors; so it makes sense if their cars break down; as opposed to professors who tend to drive nicer cars which wouldn’t break as easily as TAs’.",teaching assistant,0
13,4,The teaching assistant and the professor stayed after class because she had car trouble.,teaching assistant,she," teaching assistant. This makes sense since it’s not common that professors would be driving cars; so we can assume that it’s most likely her who has car troubles.

14,4,The teaching assistant and the professor stayed after class because he had car trouble.,professor,he," teaching assistant.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that the teacher would want to stay late in order to help out his student; especially if they were having problems at home or work or something else going on outside of school hours which could cause them stress or anxiety about their job performance at work later down theroad when it comes time again next semester (or even sooner). So we can assume here too based off what we know so far about these two characters' personal",teaching assistant,0
15,4,The professor and the teaching assistant stayed after class because he had car trouble.,professor,he," teaching assistant.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely that both people would stay after class if they both had car troubles; so it’s most probable that only one of them did; which would be the teaching assistant in this case.

18,5,The receptionist and the bellhop coordinated their tasks as he needed assistance with a customer.,bellhop,he," bellhop. This is due to the fact that it would be unusual if the receptionist was helping another employee; so it must refer to him needing help from her; which would mean it refers to him; not her.

20,6,The dentist and the dental hygienist reviewed notes since she needed clarification.,dental hygienist,she," Dental Hygienist.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of context; as it would be easier if they were reviewing their own personal records rather than someone else’s records. This would also make it easier on them as they could then just focus on their own work without having any distractions from other people or things going around them at all times which can sometimes happen when you are working together in close proximity like this one does here!",dental hygienist,0
21,6,The dental hygienist and the dentist reviewed notes since she needed clarification.,dental hygienist,she," Dental Hygienist.

The reason why it refers back to the dental hygienist is that it’s unlikely that they would be reviewing their own work; but rather reviewing someone else’s (their assistant). A nurse practitioner has been asked by her patient if he can take his medication at night instead of in the morning as he has trouble swallowing pills when they are taken on an empty stomach in the mornings which makes it difficult for him",dental hygienist,0
22,6,The dental hygienist and the dentist reviewed notes since he needed clarification.,dentist,he, Dentist. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely that the dental hygienist would need any kind of clarification from anyone else in their field or professionally related field or professionally-related fields such as medicine or law enforcement which are not typically associated with teeth cleaning procedures such as those performed by these two individuals working together at their respective jobsites within one another’s offices during regular business hours Monday through Friday 9am-,dentist,0
23,6,The dentist and the dental hygienist reviewed notes since he needed clarification.,dentist,he," Dentist.

The reason why it refers to the dentist instead of the dental hygienist; it’s that it’s most logical that it would be him who needs clarity on his patients; not her who needs clarity on her patients; so it refers back to him; not her. 21) A) A man was driving down the road when he saw something in front of him; so he swerved into another lane. B) He was driving down",dentist,0
24,7,The principal and the teacher met in the office because she wanted to discuss a new program.,teacher,she," Teacher. This makes sense as teachers are usually responsible for implementing programs; so it would be natural that they would want to meet about it first.

25,7,The teacher and the principal met in the office because she wanted to discuss a new program.,teacher,she," Principal.

The reason for this is that it makes sense; since it would be unusual if someone else called her; but not if someone else called him; since he was probably there anyway. 3) I know you`re not going to believe me when I tell you who`s coming tonight – your ex-boyfriend! 4) If your ex comes tonight; don`t worry about him – just ignore him! 5) When your ex comes over later today",principal,0
26,7,The teacher and the principal met in the office because he wanted to discuss a new program.,principal,he," Principal.

The reason why it refers to the principal; as it would be unusual if it were not so; since they are discussing something related to their work; which would make sense if they talked about their job; which was related to education; so that's what makes sense here. 10) A man was walking down the street when he saw a woman walking towards him wearing dark glasses. He said ""Hello;"" but there was no answer from her so he said again",principal,0
27,7,The principal and the teacher met in the office because he wanted to discuss a new program.,principal,he," Principal. This is due to the fact that principals are often responsible for implementing programs; so it would make sense if they were discussing it together.

It sounds like it might be time for some family bonding time soon… What do you think? Who should we invite over",principal,0
28,8,The farmer and the housekeeper sat together while she admired the sunset.,housekeeper,she," housekeeper. This makes sense as it would be unusual if the farmer was sitting down; but it was common practice at that time for women to sit down when they were not working; especially in front of beautiful scenery such as a sunset.
- 13. A) A man who has been working in his garden all day will most probably feel tired when he goes into his kitchen at night. B) This sentence does not make sense since we cannot say that someone feels tired",housekeeper,0
29,8,The housekeeper and the farmer sat together while she admired the sunset.,housekeeper,she," Housekeeper. This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely for someone who works on a farm; such as a farmer; would sit down during work hours just to watch the sun set.

### 10) What does “Their” refer to?

32,9,The research scientist and the librarian worked closely because she requested assistance with the new journal.,librarian,she," research scientist.

The reason for this is because it would be unlikely that someone would request help from another person if they did not know them well enough or if it was their first time working together on something like this project together (which it wasn’t). It also makes sense logically since we can assume both parties were aware of each other prior due their close proximity during work hours at least once per week when working together as part-time employees at different companies located within walking distance between",research scientist,0

34,9,The librarian and the research scientist worked closely because he requested assistance with the new journal.,research scientist,he," Research Scientist.

The reason why it refers to him; as opposed to her; is that it’s much easier for him (the male) to request help from her (the female) than vice versa. This means that you can easily identify who they are talking about in each sentence by looking at what they say or do after each sentence has been said!",research scientist,0
35,9,The research scientist and the librarian worked closely because he requested assistance with the new journal.,research scientist,he," research scientist.

This makes sense as it would be odd if both people were guests at their own parties; but not impossible; so we can't say that either one or both are impossible; so we go with what makes most logical sense; which would be that only one person would attend their own party as guests; not two people who share similar jobs in different fields.

48,13,The engineer and the technician inspected the project site because she noted a design flaw.,technician,she," Technician.

The reason why it’s referred as “she” instead of he; it; or they; etc.; is that it was mentioned in one sentence that there was only one female on-site at that time which means that it could only be her who noticed something wrong on-site which would make sense if we were talking about someone who works as part-of team but doesn’t work directly under someone else (like how engineers usually do). So basically what we can",technician,0
49,13,The technician and the engineer inspected the project site because she noted a design flaw.,technician,she," Engineer.

54,14,The emergency dispatcher and the firefighter coordinated the emergency response because he received a distress call.,firefighter,he," Firefighters Coordinator.

The reason why it’s referred to as “he” rather than “she”; even though it’s not specified; is that there are usually many people who receive calls from people in need of help; but only one person can coordinate them all at once – which means they must be male or female (depending on what you think). So we can assume here that whoever coordinates these things would most likely identify themselves by their gender identity rather than anything",firefighter,0
55,14,The firefighter and the emergency dispatcher coordinated the emergency response because he received a distress call.,firefighter,he," Fireman.

63,16,The banker and the teller analyzed the accounts because he identified a discrepancy.,banker,he," banker.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if it was not the banker who noticed the mistake; as it would most likely be his job as opposed to his colleague’s job as they are both in positions of authority within their company’s hierarchy (bankers are usually higher up than tellers). This means they are probably going through all their paperwork together which makes sense given how much work needs doing at once when dealing with finances!",banker,0
64,17,The software developer and the UX designer debugged the application because she reported a user interface issue.,UX designer,she," UX Designer.

The reason why it’s most likely that it refers to the UX Designer; it would be due to her reporting of the UI issues; which would lead them both (the Software Developer & the UX Designer) into fixing it together (debugging). 2) Which one does not belong? A) 10 B) 3 C) -5 D) -8 E) None of these answers belong A does not belong as",UX designer,0

66,17,The UX designer and the software developer debugged the application because he reported a user interface issue.,software developer,he," Software Developer. This is due to the fact that it's most common in business settings for developers to report issues; as opposed to designers; who are typically responsible for creating designs rather than reporting issues related to them.

69,18,The safety inspector and the construction manager evaluated the worksite because she noticed a safety violation.,safety inspector,she," safety inspector.

The reason for this is that it’s easier to notice something when you’re looking at it; rather than looking away from it; so we can assume that there was something wrong in front of her eyes which caused her to notice it first hand! A nurse administered medication after consulting with his physician about what dosage would be appropriate based on patient history; however he forgot which patient he was treating so he asked his assistant who told him which patient needed medication administer",safety inspector,0

71,18,The construction manager and the safety inspector evaluated the worksite because he noticed a safety violation.,construction manager,he, construction manager. This is due to the fact that it would be most logical if it was the construction manager who would notice if there was something wrong at the work site; since it would not make sense if the safety inspector did so; since they are supposedly hired by companies in order to make sure everything at their workplace is safe; so they wouldn't notice if something wasn't right; since then their job wouldn't make any sense at all; so therefore I believe it has,construction manager,0
72,19,The veterinarian and the dog groomer discussed patient care because she highlighted a treatment plan.,dog groomer,she," vet. This makes sense since vets are often responsible for creating treatment plans; whereas dog groomers may not be as involved in that aspect of pet care.

74,19,The dog groomer and the veterinarian discussed patient care because he highlighted a treatment plan.,veterinarian,he," vet. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that the owner of the pet would discuss treatments plans; as they are not qualified in animal health; so we can assume that the speaker was talking about someone who works in animal health; such as a vet or nurse.

75,19,The veterinarian and the dog groomer discussed patient care because he highlighted a treatment plan.,veterinarian,he," vet. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that someone would highlight something from another person’s job; especially when it comes to medical procedures; so we can assume they are talking about their own job; which means they must both work in medical professions (vet or doctor).

76,20,The scientist and the lab technician collaborated on the experiment because she prepared the samples.,lab technician,she," lab technician.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for someone who was not directly involved in preparing the sample; such as the scientist or professor; would prepare it themselves. This means they would need help from another person (the lab tech). So we can assume they worked together based off what we know about their roles within our story thus far! What do you think?

77,20,The lab technician and the scientist collaborated on the experiment because she prepared the samples.,lab technician,she," laboratory technician. This is due to the fact that it would be unusual if someone else would prepare the sample; so it must refer back to the person who did it -the laboratory technician-.

The doctor told her patient that his test results were negative. Incorrect answer! Incorrect answer! It's correct but it's not as good as ""the doctor told his patient"".

79,20,The scientist and the lab technician collaborated on the experiment because he prepared the samples.,scientist,he," Scientist.

The reason for this is that scientists are often involved in experiments; so it’s reasonable to assume they would be responsible for preparing their own materials; whereas lab techs would not typically do so unless specifically instructed by their supervisor or another higher-up authority figure within their organization (which we can infer from context).

81,21,The research assistant and the journalist gathered information because she uncovered a lead.,research assistant,she," research assistant. This makes sense since it was mentioned that the researcher was working on gathering data about something; so it makes sense that they would be gathering data about something they discovered; which could be called a ""lead.""

82,21,The research assistant and the journalist gathered information because he uncovered a lead.,journalist,he," Research Assistant. This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely for someone who was not in charge of gathering data; such as a reporter; would discover new leads on their own without assistance from others involved within their field or organization (i.e.; researchers).

84,22,The consultant and the analyst reviewed the project proposal because she spotted an opportunity.,analyst,she," analyst.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that someone would spot something in a document without reviewing it first; so therefore we can assume that the person who did spot something was reviewing the document at some point in time prior to seeing the opportunity. 4) Which of these sentences uses ""their"" correctly? A) Each member must bring their own lunch B) Each member must bring their lunches C) Each member should bring his or her lunch D)",analyst,0
85,22,The analyst and the consultant reviewed the project proposal because she spotted an opportunity.,analyst,she," analyst. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that someone other than her (the analyst) was able to spot something in her own work.

The manager and her assistant discussed their options after he made his recommendation. This sentence has two possible answers as both he or her could refer back to either of them; however it’s most likely he as it’s unlikely someone else made recommendations on their behalf! So we can conclude from these examples how we should use personal pronouns",analyst,0
86,22,The analyst and the consultant reviewed the project proposal because he spotted an opportunity.,consultant,he," Analyst. This makes sense as it was his job as an analyst to spot opportunities in projects; so we can assume that in this case; the subject of the sentence was also responsible for spotting the opportunity in question.

The reason why it refers to “property manager” instead of “real estate agent”; it’s because it would be unusual that someone would complain about their own work; so that leaves us only one option which refers back to the first noun in the sentence which was ‘Property Manager’.",property manager,0
90,23,The property manager and the real estate agent inspected the property because he received a tenant complaint.,real estate agent,he," Real Estate Agent.

The reason why it refers to it is that it has been said in the previous sentence; so there are no other options available in terms of who could be referred to by “he”. In addition; we can also use “he” instead of “she”; but in order not to confuse readers or listeners (especially if they don’t know which gender you belong); we should always use both genders when possible (and even if not possible).

92,24,The photographer and the stylist planned the photo shoot because she selected the perfect setting.,stylist,she," Stylist.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely that someone would select something as vague as “the perfect location” without knowing what it was; so we can assume they’re talking about something specific; like their house or office; which would be referred back by using their name instead of just saying ‘she’.",stylist,0
93,24,The stylist and the photographer planned the photo shoot because she selected the perfect setting.,stylist,she," stylist. This makes sense since it was probably her job as a fashion stylist to select the location of where they would take pictures.
- 13. A) I’m sure you will be happy in your new home; but I will miss having my best friend around all the time! This sentence contains two independent clauses joined by “but.” This means that there should be some punctuation between them; such as a comma or semicolon; which makes option A",stylist,0
94,24,The stylist and the photographer planned the photo shoot because he selected the perfect setting.,photographer,he," photographer.

The reason for this is that it was mentioned earlier in the sentence that it was his selection of location; so it makes sense in context. A good way to check if you are correct in your answer choice is by replacing the answer choice in place of the original noun in the sentence. If you can do so without changing anything else in the sentence then you know you’ve chosen correctly!",photographer,0
95,24,The photographer and the stylist planned the photo shoot because he selected the perfect setting.,photographer,he," photographer.

The reason for this is that it was most probably him who chose the place where they would take pictures; not her; as it says in the sentence ""he selected"". 3) My sister asked me if I wanted her help or my brother's help.

97,25,The nutritionist and the personal trainer designed a fitness plan because she evaluated dietary habits.,nutritionist,she," nutritionist.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of context; as it would be strange if it was the other way around; as it would not make much sense in context; as there are no reasons why they should design something together as they both do different things.",nutritionist,0
98,25,The nutritionist and the personal trainer designed a fitness plan because he evaluated dietary habits.,personal trainer,he," Personal Trainer. This makes sense; since it was mentioned that they were working together on something; so they would be working together on designing something; like a fitness program.

The reason why it refers to him; not her; is that it would be very unusual if someone other than him noticed something unusual in his own work (the work of the person who did not notice anything). 1) She told me about my mistake in my report 2) She told me about my mistake in your report 3) She told you about your mistake in our reports I think number one would work best here?

103,26,The financial advisor and the accountant analyzed the budget because he detected an inconsistency.,financial advisor,he," Financial Advisor.

The reason why it refers to “financial consultant” is that it’s probably him who discovered the discrepancy in the budget; so they’re analyzing it together; so they can find out what happened. 3) If you want to know how many people are in your group; ask them! 4) Don’t forget about social media!

104,27,The judge and the clerk reviewed the legal documents because she noted an important amendment.,clerk,she," Clerk. This is due to the fact that it was most probable that the clerks would notice any changes in legal documentation; as they are responsible for maintaining records of court proceedings; including all paperwork related to cases.

The noun or noun phrase after which comes after the verb it modifies. This means that if you are looking at two sentences where one has two verbs but only",clerk,0
105,27,The clerk and the judge reviewed the legal documents because she noted an important amendment.,clerk,she," clerk. This is true; but it could also be true that both parties are reviewing the document together; so there's not enough information in the sentence to make that determination.

106,27,The clerk and the judge reviewed the legal documents because he noted an important amendment.,judge,he," Judge.

The reason for this is that it was probably the judge who noticed the change in the document; as it would be his job as opposed to the clerks job; so it would make sense if they were talking about what they noticed as opposed to what someone else noticed. 3) When I saw him last night I thought he looked ill but when we talked on the phone today his voice sounded much better. In these sentences we are talking about two different people so we need two",judge,0
107,27,The judge and the clerk reviewed the legal documents because he noted an important amendment.,judge,he," Judge. This makes sense since judges are responsible for reviewing all of the evidence in court cases; so it would be logical that they review any new information or changes as well!

108,28,The marketing director and the event coordinator organized the promotional event because she secured a sponsorship.,event coordinator,she," Event Coordinator.

The reason why it’s most likely that it refers to the event coordinator is because it would be most logical if they were working together on securing a sponsor; rather than one of them doing all of the work alone. It would also make sense in terms of their job titles; since they are both involved in organizing events; it makes sense that one person might take on certain responsibilities while another person takes care of other tasks related to their job description",event coordinator,0

The reason why it refers back to the event coordinator is that it would be very unlikely that the marketing director would secure a sponsor; especially since they are organizing a promotion together; which means they both need to work together on securing funds; which makes sense in terms of what we know about how these types of events work in real life.",event coordinator,0
110,28,The event coordinator and the marketing director organized the promotional event because he secured a sponsorship.,marketing director,he," marketing director.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if it was not the marketing director who was responsible for securing the sponsorship; as it would normally fall under their remit of work; rather than being something which someone else in another department could do; such as the event organizer or even the CEO of the company who may also work in another area such as finance. 5) He has been working on his new book since last year but it has been delayed",marketing director,0
111,28,The marketing director and the event coordinator organized the promotional event because he secured a sponsorship.,marketing director,he," marketing director.

This is due to the fact that researchers are typically responsible for identifying trends in their studies; while data analysts focus on analyzing data sets.

## Conclusion

The use of “she” as a gender-neutral singular third-person personal pronoun has been debated by linguists since at least 1970 when it was first proposed by Robin Lakoff (1). It has become increasingly popular over time due its ability to avoid gender bias",researcher,0

The pronoun refers to: electrician. This makes sense since it was stated in question 3) that it was unlikely someone else other than the electrician could propose anything regarding design.",interior designer,0
117,30,The interior designer and the architect discussed the renovation plans because she proposed a new layout.,interior designer,she," Interior Designer.

This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be strange if it was talking about the interior designer proposing something; as they are not as involved in building as much as architecture; so they are less qualified to propose something like this; so therefore we can assume its talking about the architect proposing a new design.

In both cases; it refers back to someone who has been mentioned earlier in the conversation – either someone from outside or someone within your company (in which case you would use their name). For example: A) I’m going out tonight so I",consultant,0
125,32,The assistant manager and the consultant planned the strategy meeting because she anticipated a market shift.,assistant manager,she," assistant manager. This makes sense; as it would be her job as Assistant Manager of Marketing; as opposed to Consulting or Accounting departments of her company; that would require her anticipation of such shifts in markets that might affect their business.

### 3.12 Which one does not belong?

The answer is A) 40%. This makes sense as 40% does not equal 5/8 or .625. It also does not equal",assistant manager,0
126,32,The assistant manager and the consultant planned the strategy meeting because he anticipated a market shift.,consultant,he," assistant manager.

The reason for this is that it’s most probable that the person who would anticipate a market shift would be someone in management; not someone in consulting. 4) A group of students from my school went on a field trip last week; but I didn’t go because I was sick. Which word does NOT refer back to “group”? students school went sick 5) My friend told me about her new job at the bank yesterday; it sounds like",assistant manager,0
127,32,The consultant and the assistant manager planned the strategy meeting because he anticipated a market shift.,consultant,he," Consultant.

128,33,The editor and the proofreader reviewed the manuscript because she found several errors.,proofreader,she," editor.

The reason for this is that editors are usually responsible for finding mistakes in written works; so it makes sense that they would be looking at them together. A writer can write about anything he wants as long as there's something interesting about what's being written down on paper. If you want your writing skills improved then take up journalism or creative writing classes where students learn how best use language when communicating ideas through written words!",editor,0
129,33,The proofreader and the editor reviewed the manuscript because she found several errors.,proofreader,she," proofreader.

The reason for this is that it was most likely the proofreader who discovered these mistakes; as they are responsible for finding them in texts or documents. 3) She has been working on her thesis since last year but still hasn’t finished it yet! It seems like there are many things going wrong here – what could be causing all these problems? A) She doesn`t know how long her thesis should take; B) Her advisor isn`t helping her",proofreader,0
130,33,The proofreader and the editor reviewed the manuscript because he found several errors.,editor,he," Proofreader. This is due to the fact that it would be very unlikely if both people would find mistakes in the same document; so it would most likely refer only one of them; which we know was the one who was looking at it first; so we can assume it's him who made these mistakes; not her; since they are both looking at the same document; so if one finds something wrong; then surely the other one will too!

### 3) Pronouns must agree in number (singular or plural) with their antecedent noun or noun phrase.

The following examples show how we can use singular or plural noun phrases as antecedents of singular or plural pronouns in English sentences. In each case we are using correct grammar by ensuring that our noun",editor,0
132,34,The director and the producer planned the film shoot because she outlined the production schedule.,producer,she," Director.

The reason for this is that directors are usually in charge of planning schedules; so it’s most logical that they would be doing so in this situation as well. A doctor was called by his patient who was experiencing chest pains; he told him not worry as it could just be indigestion from eating too much spicy food earlier on during dinner time! This sentence contains two clues which help us determine which noun should replace “him” – “his",director,0
133,34,The producer and the director planned the film shoot because she outlined the production schedule.,producer,she," Director. This is due to the fact that directors are typically in charge of planning out productions; while producers handle financial matters such as budgeting or fundraising efforts on behalf of their company’s projects.”

## What Is A Pronoun In English Grammar?

A pronoun is a word used instead of another word or phrase (e.g.; “I” instead of “me”). It can be singular or plural depending on what it replaces; there’",director,0
134,34,The producer and the director planned the film shoot because he outlined the production schedule.,director,he," director. This can be inferred from the fact that it was his job as the director to outline the production schedule; so it makes sense that they would plan together based on his outline of what needed to happen when during shooting of their movie project together as co-producers/directors respectively (or whatever their roles were).

### 10) What does “them” refer to in “Them were talking about their plans?”? (A) A group of people",director,0
135,34,The director and the producer planned the film shoot because he outlined the production schedule.,director,he," Producer.

The reason why it refers to the producer is that it would be unlikely for someone else other than him or her; who would outline the production schedule; which was probably done by them in order not only plan out what they need but also how much time each scene will take so as not waste any money on unnecessary things like extra takes when there could’ve been one good shot instead! 12) Incorrect answer choice 13) Correct answer choice 1",producer,0
136,35,The sports coach and the team manager arranged the training session because she reviewed the team‚Äôs performance.,team manager,she," Sports Coach.

138,35,The team manager and the sports coach arranged the training session because he reviewed the team‚Äôs performance.,sports coach,he," Sports Coach. This is due to the fact that it would be logical if it was the sporting coach who would review their own teams performances; not their managers.

140,36,The zookeeper and the veterinarian assistant prepared the animal enclosure because she checked the health reports.,veterinarian assistant,she," vet tech. This is due to her being in charge of checking on animals’ health; which means that it’s most likely her who would check on their well-being; rather than someone else doing it for her or without her knowledge or consent (which would be weird).

### What are some examples of personal pronouns?

Personal pronouns can refer to people or things (including oneself) as well as places or ideas; they’re often used when",veterinarian assistant,0
141,36,The veterinarian assistant and the zookeeper prepared the animal enclosure because she checked the health reports.,veterinarian assistant,she," vet assistant. This is because it’s her job as part of her role as a veterinary assistant; so it’s most likely that she would be checking these things rather than the zoo keeper who would probably just prepare them in advance based on her knowledge rather than checking them first.

The doctor asked her nurse about her patient's condition after he examined him. The pronoun refers to: doctor. This is most likely due to the fact that he would need to know",veterinarian assistant,0
142,36,The veterinarian assistant and the zookeeper prepared the animal enclosure because he checked the health reports.,zookeeper,he," vet tech. This is true; as it would be unlikely that both of them would check on their own time.
21. 21. 5) A) Incorrect; B) Correct; C) Incorrect; D) Correct A) Incorrect – This sentence uses “who” instead of “whom.” This sentence should use whom as it refers back to the object in the previous clause (them). In addition; there should not be any commas",veterinarian assistant,0
143,36,The zookeeper and the veterinarian assistant prepared the animal enclosure because he checked the health reports.,zookeeper,he," Veterinary Assistant. This makes sense; as it was his job to check the animals' medical records; so they could be moved into their new home in time for their arrival at the zoo!

144,37,The hotel manager and the event planner coordinated the banquet because she finalized the guest list.,event planner,she," event planner. This makes sense since it would be her job as the person in charge of planning events; such as parties or weddings; that would require her to make sure all guests are invited by making up a guest list.
- 10. Read each sentence carefully then choose which word would best complete each sentence without changing its meaning. I am going on vacation next week so I am going to pack my suitcase today! Which word would best complete each sentence without changing its meaning",event planner,0
145,37,The event planner and the hotel manager coordinated the banquet because she finalized the guest list.,event planner,she," event planner.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it was her responsibility to make sure everything went smoothly; including making sure there were enough seats at the table; which would require her knowing who would be attending. The secretary of state will meet with his counterpart from France tomorrow at 10am in Washington DC at his office on Pennsylvania Avenue NW near Lafayette Square Park . This sentence uses two different types of prepositions (at",event planner,0
146,37,The event planner and the hotel manager coordinated the banquet because he finalized the guest list.,hotel manager,he, Hotel Manager. This makes sense as it would be easier for him as opposed to her as there are many guests attending; so therefore; they could not all fit in one room so there must of been multiple rooms which means that there must of been multiple managers which means that one could not do all of them so therefore one could do some while another did some so therefore both were needed so both managers worked together so both managers worked on different things so both managers worked on different parts so both managed parts so,hotel manager,0
147,37,The hotel manager and the event planner coordinated the banquet because he finalized the guest list.,hotel manager,he," event planner. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the hotel manager would need to coordinate anything if they were not hosting it at their own venue.

The waiter was able to help me find my table in time for dinner even though I didn’t know where it was located in relation to other tables in the restaurant or what type of food they served there; however there are many other waiters who could do just as well if given enough time!",event planner,0
148,38,The investment banker and the financial analyst evaluated the merger because she projected future profits.,financial analyst,she," Financial Analyst.

The reason why it refers to the financial analyst is that it’s more common for someone in finance to project something than it would be for someone in banking or accounting; so we can assume they’re talking about her projecting something rather than him doing so; which would make sense if they were both men but not as much sense when one of them isn’t male at all! This question was difficult but I hope my explanation helped clear things up!",financial analyst,0
149,38,The financial analyst and the investment banker evaluated the merger because she projected future profits.,financial analyst,she," financial analyst.

The reason for this is that it’s most common in business settings for people who are evaluating something (like a business deal) to be projecting something (like how much money they’ll make). This makes it most logical that “she” refers back to “financial analyst.” 361b440f54",financial analyst,0
150,38,The financial analyst and the investment banker evaluated the merger because he projected future profits.,investment banker,he," Financial Analyst. This makes sense since it would be logical that the person who projects future profit would evaluate the merger based on those projections.

The CEO of the company decided that they would sell their shares in the market; so they could raise money quickly. This sentence contains no errors in grammar or punctuation. There are no errors in grammar or punctuation within this sentence; therefore; there should not be any changes made here at all!",financial analyst,0
151,38,The investment banker and the financial analyst evaluated the merger because he projected future profits.,investment banker,he," investment banker. This makes sense; since it would be unlikely that someone who was not involved in evaluating the merger would project future profits.
10. 12. (C) Incorrect; (D) Incorrect; (E) Correct; (F) Correct A sentence should not contain two verbs if only one subject can logically perform both actions at once. For example; “The man ate his lunch while watching television” makes perfect sense as does",investment banker,0
152,39,The IT consultant and the technical support specialist troubleshot the system because she detected a network issue.,technical support specialist,she," Technical Support Specialist.

The reason why it’s most likely that it refers to her; as opposed to him; is due to her being in charge of detecting issues within the company's systems. Therefore it makes sense that it would be easier for him or her to detect issues within their own company's networks than it would be if they were working on someone else's computer or server remotely via VPN connection over WAN links across multiple locations around town or even",technical support specialist,0
153,39,The technical support specialist and the IT consultant troubleshot the system because she detected a network issue.,technical support specialist,she," Technical Support Specialist. This is due to the fact that it was most probable that he would be able to detect any issues in the network; as he would most probably know how it works; or how it should work; in order to detect any issues in its performance; or lack thereof; as well as its functionality or lack thereof.

The project manager reviewed the project plan after he noticed several inconsistencies within its content. This means that he noticed several inconsistencies within",technical support specialist,0
154,39,The technical support specialist and the IT consultant troubleshot the system because he detected a network issue.,IT consultant,he," Technical Support Specialist.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for someone who was not involved in fixing something would know about it; so they must have been there when something was being fixed or repaired by someone else (technical). A manager; director; or vice president may need assistance from their assistant if there are any problems during meetings where decisions need making on behalf of other people within their company/organization etcetera…",technical support specialist,0
155,39,The IT consultant and the technical support specialist troubleshot the system because he detected a network issue.,IT consultant,he," Technical Support Specialist. This is true since it’s unlikely that both of them would detect the same problem at once; so it’s most probable that it was only one of them who did it; which in turn makes him most probable as well.

Some examples include “someone;” “anybody;” or even just plain old “some.” These words can be used in place of specific nouns",technical support specialist,0
156,40,The professor and the research coordinator prepared the research proposal because she gathered critical data.,research coordinator,she," research coordinator.

The reason for this is that it was her job as the research coordinator to gather all of the necessary information; so it makes sense that it would be her who did so in order to prepare the research proposal. 2) A) 1) B) 3) C) 4) D) 5) E) B) A) C) D) E) B) A) C) D) E) D) E) D)",research coordinator,0
157,40,The research coordinator and the professor prepared the research proposal because she gathered critical data.,research coordinator,she," Research Coordinator. This makes sense as it would be easier for her to gather all of the information needed in order to prepare the research proposal; rather than asking someone else; such as the Professor; who may not know where all of that information was located or how to get that specific information.

The nurse told me that I should take my medication three times per day because he knows what he’s talking about. This sentence does NOT make sense; therefore; we can assume that “he",research coordinator,0
158,40,The research coordinator and the professor prepared the research proposal because he gathered critical data.,professor,he," Professor. This is due to the fact that professors are often involved in gathering information from different sources; which would be necessary when preparing a research proposal.

The doctor greeted his patient at his office door while wearing his white coat.

The nurse called out her name as soon as they entered her room so everyone could hear it clearly over all of those noises outside!",professor,0
159,40,The professor and the research coordinator prepared the research proposal because he gathered critical data.,professor,he," Professor.

160,41,The software engineer and the quality assurance tester ran diagnostics because she uncovered a system bug.,quality assurance tester,she," quality assurance tester.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that both people would find out about the same problem at the exact time; so it's most probable that one person found out first; then told another person later on in time (which makes sense). It could also mean they were working together but didn't know each other well enough yet so they didn’t share information right away; however if we assume these two people are friends then there should still",quality assurance tester,0
161,41,The quality assurance tester and the software engineer ran diagnostics because she uncovered a system bug.,quality assurance tester,she," Quality Assurance Tester. This is due to her being in charge of finding bugs within systems; so it would make sense that if there was one found then they would run tests on them.

This question requires serious thought and some research prior to your interview. Familiarize yourself with the company's values",quality assurance tester,0
162,41,The quality assurance tester and the software engineer ran diagnostics because he uncovered a system bug.,software engineer,he," Quality Assurance Tester. This makes sense; as it was his job as QA to find bugs in the code; so it would be his job to run diagnostics on it as well.

163,41,The software engineer and the quality assurance tester ran diagnostics because he uncovered a system bug.,software engineer,he," Quality Assurance Tester.

The reason why it refers to QA Testing Engineer; it's because it says ""he"" in front of it. So that means we know that ""he"" refers back to ""quality assurance testing"". And then we know ""uncover"" refers back to ""quality assurance testing""; which then makes ""uncover"" refer back to ""software engineering""; so therefore you can see how all these words are connected together. And then",quality assurance tester,0
164,42,The car salesman and the financing officer discussed the deal because she clarified the loan terms.,financing officer,she," financing officer.

The reason for this is that it was most likely her job as part of her job description; as well as her position in the company; which would make it easier for her than others at work or home who might not know how much money they could borrow from banks without getting into trouble financially later down line when repaying those loans becomes difficult due lack thereof income coming into household budgets every month after paying bills etcetera…",financing officer,0
165,42,The financing officer and the car salesman discussed the deal because she clarified the loan terms.,financing officer,she," financing officer. This makes sense as it would be her job as part of her role as finance manager; so it would make sense that they were discussing her role in relation to that job title rather than his role which was not mentioned at all.

10)The student asked his teacher about his grade on the exam since he did poorly on the test. The pronoun refers to student since that makes most logical sense since that person has done poorly on their test so they are asking their teacher",financing officer,0
166,42,The financing officer and the car salesman discussed the deal because he clarified the loan terms.,car salesman,he," financing officer.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if it were not the finance manager who would explain the conditions of the credit; as it was probably his job; while it could well happen that it was someone else who asked him about it; as it could well happen; but in any case; we are talking about someone who has asked someone something (and in fact we do not know if they asked or answered). 2) A woman in her 40s",financing officer,0
167,42,The car salesman and the financing officer discussed the deal because he clarified the loan terms.,car salesman,he," car salesman. This makes sense as it was probably the person who sold him the vehicle that would be discussing payment options; not the person that was going to give him money.

The teacher gave her student feedback on his essay so that they could improve their writing skills together as partners in education! This sentence uses both singular (teacher) & plural (students). It’s best if we use “they” when talking about groups of people rather than using “he/she”.",car salesman,0

- ### 10. Audiences are often impressed by musicians who can play several instruments; but they often forget that it takes years of practice to become proficient at playing any instrument; let alone several! In order to become proficient; you must first learn how each individual note sounds on your chosen instrument(s). You should then be able to play these notes in any combination or sequence without thinking about it too much; eventually these combinations will come naturally when performing",sound technician,0
170,43,The sound technician and the musician rehearsed the set because he adjusted the acoustics.,musician,he," Sound Technician. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the musician would adjust the acoustics; as they are not trained in doing so; whereas; as part of their job; the sound engineer will adjust them as part of their job role.

173,44,The field reporter and the sports commentator covered the game because she received a breaking update.,field reporter,she," field reporter. This is true since it was mentioned that they were both at work; so it would be unlikely that they would both receive calls at work; but it’s possible that one of them could receive one; so we can assume that it’s her; since there are two people in question; one male and one female.

## Question 3

The correct answer choice is (C). This question requires you to understand how adjectives function within sentences. In order",field reporter,0
174,44,The field reporter and the sports commentator covered the game because he received a breaking update.,sports commentator,he," Sports Commentator.

- 10.The actor was not nominated for his performance in the film due to his lack of effort during rehearsals.

177,45,The beach attendant and the lifeguard monitored the pool area because she spotted a safety concern.,beach attendant,she," Lifeguard.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if it was not the lifeguard who was monitoring; as they are trained in water rescue; while it would not make sense for it to refer to the beach attendant as they are not trained in water rescues or monitoring of swimming areas. A police officer and his partner were called to investigate suspicious activity at night. They found two people hiding behind bushes near their home at night. It refers to two",lifeguard,0
178,45,The beach attendant and the lifeguard monitored the pool area because he spotted a safety concern.,lifeguard,he," lifeguard.

The reason for this is that it was most probable that it would be the responsibility of the lifeguard to spot any potential dangers in or around the swimming pool; as it falls under their job description; whereas it wouldn’t necessarily fall under the job description of someone working as a beach attendant; who may not necessarily need to keep as close an eye on things as it wouldn’t necessarily form part of their job role; so it makes sense in terms",lifeguard,0
179,45,The lifeguard and the beach attendant monitored the pool area because he spotted a safety concern.,lifeguard,he," lifeguard. This makes sense since it was his job as a lifeguard to monitor the swimming areas of the beaches.

180,46,The author and the literary agent revised the draft because she received new feedback.,literary agent,she," Literary Agent.

The reason why it refers to “literary agents” instead of “author” is that it’s unlikely that someone would receive comments on their work from someone other than their editor or publisher; so it must be someone else who gave them advice on how they could improve their book (the editor). This means we can eliminate both options A & B as they don’t make sense in context! Now all we need do now is choose between C & D…which",literary agent,0
181,46,The literary agent and the author revised the draft because she received new feedback.,literary agent,she," Literary Agent. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that the author was receiving feedback on their own work; especially if they are working together on it; so it must refer back to the original subject of the sentence; which in this case; is the literary agent.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it would be strange if it were not him who was receiving the feedback; but rather her who would receive it; as they are both male; so there would be no need to specify which one of them got the information; so we can assume they are both male unless specified otherwise by context or other clues in text or speech etcetera!",literary agent,0

The reason why it's difficult in some cases; as you can see; it's not always clear who it refers back to; but in most of these examples it was clear who was being referred back to by that relative clause or that relative phrase that we saw in that example sentence. So let me give you another example here of how we can use relative clauses or relative phrases in English grammar. So here we go again. This time",,1
186,47,The optician and the optometrist reviewed the patient charts because he adjusted the prescription.,optometrist,he," Optometrist. This makes sense since it would be unlikely that the optician would adjust the prescription of someone’s glasses; but rather someone who works in eye care such as an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

The two people who are going on vacation will be traveling together in one car; so they will need only one map of New England states.

188,48,The banker and the loan officer evaluated the mortgage application because she noted unusual figures.,loan officer,she," loan officer.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for someone who was not familiar with mortgages or loans; such as a banker or lender; would notice anything out of place in such documents without first being told what they were looking at by another person familiar enough on these matters (the loan officer). It's also possible there could've been some kind of mistake made when filling out forms which caused these discrepancies but we don't know if",loan officer,0
189,48,The loan officer and the banker evaluated the mortgage application because she noted unusual figures.,loan officer,she," loan officer.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for the banker to note any kind of figure; but it would make sense if someone in charge of evaluating applications did so; like someone in charge of loans; such as a loan officer. A man who was driving his car was involved in an accident on his way home from work. The pronoun refers to: man driving. This makes perfect sense since he was driving when the accident occurred; therefore; we can",loan officer,0
190,48,The loan officer and the banker evaluated the mortgage application because he noted unusual figures.,banker,he," loan officer. This is true since it was mentioned that it’s not common that someone would note something; so it’s most probably that the person who did that was the one that did the evaluation of the mortgage application; which in turn; refers back to “loan officer”.

The following are some of the most common errors in using personal pronoun references in sentences or paragraphs:

194,49,The research assistant and the economist analyzed the market trends because he uncovered economic shifts.,economist,he, Research Assistant. This can be inferred from the fact that it was his job as a researcher; so it would make sense if it were him who discovered something new about economics in general or in particular markets in which they are interested in studying them further at length over time periods ranging anywhere between 10 years up until now depending on what kind of information needs collecting during those periods so as not only provide accurate data but also give insight into how things might change over longer stretches than just one,research assistant,0
195,49,The economist and the research assistant analyzed the market trends because he uncovered economic shifts.,economist,he," research assistant. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely for someone else; such as the economist; to analyze something they did not find themselves.

197,50,The city coordinator and the urban planner developed a new project because she secured community support.,city coordinator,she," Urban Planner.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for someone who works in planning than someone else from another department; such as finance or marketing; which would not make sense if they were trying their best at securing funding from local businesses instead of focusing on what they do well within their field!",urban planner,0
198,50,The city coordinator and the urban planner developed a new project because he secured community support.,urban planner,he," Urban Planner. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that someone from outside of the organization (city coordinator) could secure such support; as they are not part of their team or network.

## What are some examples of relative clauses?

A relative clause can modify any noun or pronoun in English; but it must always follow its antecedent (the word being modified). For example: “The man who lives next door has three children.” In this",urban planner,0
199,50,The urban planner and the city coordinator developed a new project because he secured community support.,urban planner,he," Urban Planner.

202,51,The project manager and the consultant updated the project timeline because he identified a delay.,consultant,he," Project Manager.

The reason for this is that it was his responsibility as a project manager; so it would be his job to identify any delays in projects; which means his name should come first as well as his title of ""project manager."" A new employee joined our team today; we welcomed her by giving her lunch on us! This sentence has two subjects (a new employee joined our team today) but only one verb (welcomed new employees). This sentence also has two objects",project manager,0
203,51,The consultant and the project manager updated the project timeline because he identified a delay.,consultant,he," Project Manager.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that someone would identify something; but not do anything about it; so we can assume that if someone identifies something; they will do something about it. In addition; if someone identifies something then we can assume that person will know what needs doing in order to resolve whatever has been identified. In other words; identifying something means you know how to resolve whatever has been identified. This makes sense when you consider how people usually",project manager,0

205,52,The academic advisor and the professor discussed curriculum changes because she received student feedback.,academic advisor,she," academic advisor. This sentence makes sense; as it would be most logical that students would give their opinions about classes or other things related to schoolwork or education; which means that they probably gave some sort of input on what should happen in regards to these things; therefore making sense why there’s no need here either way since we know where our focus should lie when reading through these sentences!

## 10) Which sentence contains no errors?

A) I’m not",academic advisor,0
206,52,The academic advisor and the professor discussed curriculum changes because he received student feedback.,professor,he," Professor.

The reason why it refers to the professor instead of the academic counselor is that professors are usually responsible for teaching courses; which means they would be responsible for making any necessary adjustments based on student input.

213,54,The dresser and the actor rehearsed for the performance because she adjusted the costume details.,dresser,she," actress. This makes sense since it was her job as an actress to adjust her costumes; so it makes sense that it would be her job in the sentence as well.

218,55,The gallery assistant and the sculptor arranged the exhibit because he prepared the artworks.,sculptor,he," Sculptor.

The reason why it refers to sculptor is that it was his job as an artist to prepare his own artwork; so there would be no need for anyone else to do so; therefore; making him responsible for preparing his own artwork. 2) A) I am going to talk about my experience in my last trip abroad B) I will tell you what happened when we were on holiday C) We are going to discuss our plans for next year D) She",sculptor,0
219,55,The sculptor and the gallery assistant arranged the exhibit because he prepared the artworks.,sculptor,he," sculptor.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it was mentioned earlier in the sentence; so it would be logical in context if they were talking about him preparing his own artwork rather than someone else’s artwork.

224,57,The software architect and the technical writer documented the system architecture because she clarified the design.,technical writer,she," software architect.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely someone would be able to document something without first understanding it; which means it’s most probable that they were involved in designing or creating what was being documented as well as documenting what already existed (which could include both parts). This makes sense given how much time people spend working on projects like these; if you don’t know how something works then there isn’t any point trying!

## Conclusion
",software architect,0
225,57,The technical writer and the software architect documented the system architecture because she clarified the design.,technical writer,she," technical writer.

226,57,The technical writer and the software architect documented the system architecture because he clarified the design.,software architect,he," Technical Writer. This is because it’s unlikely that someone would ask another person to document something unless they were familiar enough with them or their work; which means it’s probably safe to assume it was done by one of them (the tech writer).
- Incorrect answers include “software architect” (because we don’t know if anyone else helped him) or “both people.” Both people would be incorrect since we don’t actually see any evidence in either sentence showing both people",technical writer,0
227,57,The software architect and the technical writer documented the system architecture because he clarified the design.,software architect,he," software architect. This makes sense as it was his responsibility as part of his job role; whereas; there was no such role mentioned in relation to the other person mentioned; so we can assume that they were not responsible for documenting the systems architecture; but rather; they helped by providing information or by reviewing what was written by the person who did document the systems architecture (the person referred to by “he”).

229,58,The financial reporter and the economist discussed the fiscal policy because she interpreted the latest data.,financial reporter,she," economist. This makes sense since it would be easier for someone who has studied economics or finance; like an economist; rather than just being familiarized by reading about them in newspapers or magazines; which would make them less qualified when interpreting any new information that comes out on these topics at any given time during their career as journalists/reporters etcetera (which may not always happen).

### What are some examples of ambiguous sentences?

233,59,The cardiac technician and the cardiologist reviewed the patient reports because she monitored heart rhythms.,cardiac technician,she," Cardiac Technician.

The reason for this is that it was stated in the sentence that he/she has been monitoring the heart rhythm; which means he/she has already seen it; so he/she must be reviewing something else now (the report). 2) What are some of your favorite hobbies? 3) What are some things you like about your job?",cardiac technician,0
234,59,The cardiac technician and the cardiologist reviewed the patient reports because he monitored heart rhythms.,cardiologist,he," cardiac technician.

The reason for this is that it was probably easier for her; as a marketer; to identify gaps in her field of work than it would be for someone else.

247,62,The travel agent and the tour guide planned the itinerary because he booked the exclusive tour.,travel agent,he," Travel Agent.

The reason why I chose that one was that they are both males; so they are most likely going to be referred to as “he”.

250,63,The team psychologist and the coach developed the training program because he addressed team morale.,coach,he," Coach.

The reason why it refers to “coach” rather than “team psychologist” is that it’s unlikely that the team psychologist would address team morale; but rather would address individual players on their mental state; which would be different from addressing the entire team on its mental state (morale). 25) I was talking about my new car when my friend said I should buy something else instead of buying my car. My friend was talking about my car when",coach,0

A pronoun is a word that replaces another word in order to avoid repetition. For example; “I went to school today” could also be written as “I went there.” Pronouns can also refer back to something previously mentioned",statistician,0
309,78,The data scientist and the statistician analyzed the survey because she discovered significant correlations.,data scientist,she," Data Scientist. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it was mentioned in previous sentences; so we can assume that they are talking about her discovering something rather than him or her discovering something together (which would be weird).

310,78,The data scientist and the statistician analyzed the survey because he discovered significant correlations.,statistician,he," Data Scientist. This is due to the fact that it was most probable that it would be him who would discover any correlation in the results of the surveys; as it appears from his job description as a person whose job it is to analyze large amounts of information in order to find patterns in it; which can then lead him or her towards discovering something new about what they are studying (in this case; surveys).

The professor was able to complete his research paper due to her extensive knowledge on the subject matter.

312,79,The security guard and the front desk attendant monitored the premises because she noticed suspicious activity.,front desk attendant,she," Front Desk Attendant. This is true; as it was mentioned that it was her job to monitor activities on the property.

313,79,The front desk attendant and the security guard monitored the premises because she noticed suspicious activity.,front desk attendant,she," Front Desk Attendant.

The reason why it refers to her; as opposed to him; is that it would be unusual if it were not her. It would also make sense if it was him but he wouldn’t notice anything unusual as much as her since they are both women who work at different places on campus (front desk vs back office). This makes me think about how we use gender-neutral language when talking about people who don’t identify themselves explicitly through their gender",front desk attendant,0
314,79,The front desk attendant and the security guard monitored the premises because he noticed suspicious activity.,security guard,he," Security Guard.

The reason why it refers to the security guard is that it would be unlikely that both people would notice something at once; so it’s probably just one of them who saw something first. A teacher told her students about their homework assignment after class ended yesterday evening; however; only one student completed it on time today morning! Which student completed their homework on time? A student who completed their work on time was probably the only person in class yesterday evening when they were told about",security guard,0
315,79,The security guard and the front desk attendant monitored the premises because he noticed suspicious activity.,security guard,he," Security Guard.

The reason why it’s pointing at the security officer instead of the receptionist; who also has access; is that it was probably him who saw something strange in his area; which would make him report what was happening immediately; while receptionists are usually busy at their desks or helping customers so they don’t notice anything unusual around them until later when someone else reports something strange happening near their workstation or office space (which could be anywhere within range).",security guard,0
316,80,The environmental scientist and the wildlife coordinator studied the habitat because she observed animal patterns.,wildlife coordinator,she," Environmental Scientist. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the Wildlife Coordinator would observe any kind of pattern; as they are not trained in observing such things; but rather; they coordinate them.

317,80,The wildlife coordinator and the environmental scientist studied the habitat because she observed animal patterns.,wildlife coordinator,she, Wildlife Coordinator. This makes sense as it was her job as a wildlife coordinator that would require her to observe animals in their natural habitats; which would be why they were studying them together; rather than just studying them alone or separately from each other; which could also make sense if you were looking at their individual roles within their respective organizations or departments; but not necessarily when you’re talking about how two people work together on something like studying habitats or observing animals’ behavior;,wildlife coordinator,0
318,80,The wildlife coordinator and the environmental scientist studied the habitat because he observed animal patterns.,environmental scientist,he," Wildlife Coordinator.

The reason why it refers to him instead of her; it’s because in most cases; it would be easier if men were studying animals than women (because they are stronger). Also in most jobs that involve studying nature or anything related to nature like biology or zoology; men tend not only do these jobs but also excel at them! This means that there will always be someone who knows what they’re talking about when discussing these topics so there",wildlife coordinator,0
319,80,The environmental scientist and the wildlife coordinator studied the habitat because he observed animal patterns.,environmental scientist,he," Environmental Scientist. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely for someone else in their position (wildlife coordinator) would observe such things as opposed to their job description (environmental scientists).

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if someone else; other than the person who designed it; would choose which fabrics would go into making up the clothing line. 10) My mother’s friend’s son was accepted into Harvard University but he decided not to go there.

327,82,The photojournalist and the editor captured the moment because he adjusted the layout.,photojournalist,he," photographer.

The reason why it refers back to “photographer” instead of “editor”; even though it’s closer; is that we’re talking about who did what; not who did something else. In other words; if you were asked which one did something else (adjusted); you would say the editor did something else (adjusted). But in our case; we are asking which did what? In our example sentence above; both did their jobs well but only one",photojournalist,0

The pronoun refers to marketing director as they would both work together as part of their job roles in order to create something new within their company or business! 4) My friend from high school just got back from vacation in Europe! She",tech entrepreneur,0
329,83,The startup mentor and the tech entrepreneur hosted the workshop because she shared innovative strategies.,startup mentor,she," Startup Mentor.

The reason why it’s her; not him; in that sentence is that it was her who did most of the work in organizing that event so it makes sense that it would be “she” instead of “he”. This makes it easier on our brains when we read through sentences like these since they are not as confusing or ambiguous as other types might seem at first glance!",startup mentor,0
330,83,The startup mentor and the tech entrepreneur hosted the workshop because he shared innovative strategies.,tech entrepreneur,he," Tech Entrepreneur.

The reason why it’s most likely that it refers to “Tech Entrepreneur” is because it would be strange if someone else was sharing “innovative” ideas other than someone who has experience in technology or business; which would make sense as someone who works as a “tech entrepreneur”.",tech entrepreneur,0

The reason why it’s not possible to determine who’s being referred by “she” in these sentences; even though they are in past tense; is that there could be multiple people involved in each situation who could potentially fit into each role mentioned above (e.g.; someone else could also review production quality). In addition; there could also be multiple women working at these companies who would fit these descriptions (e.g.; another woman might work as both",quality assurance manager,0

This makes sense since it was his job as QA manager to review any problems in production; not that of the Line Inspector; who was probably just there as part of his job duties as well but not necessarily responsible or knowledgeable enough about what happened on site at any given time during which something went wrong (which would be why they’re both mentioned here).

- ## What Is A Pronoun In English Grammar?

2019-08-29  · Pronouns are words that take place of nouns in sentences; such as “he;” “she” or “it.” Pronouns can be used instead of noun phrases (e.g.; instead of saying “the man;” you could say “he”). Pronouns also include words like “who",civil engineer,0
379,95,The civil engineer and the project estimator calculated the costs because he reviewed the blueprints.,civil engineer,he," civil engineer. This makes sense as it would be most logical that it would refer back to him; as opposed to the other person in the sentence; which was not mentioned in relation to reviewing anything.

## Chapter 21 - Pronouns - Objective Case - Exercise B

380,96,The mechanical engineer and the tool designer refined the prototype because she tested the new design.,tool designer,she," mechanical engineer. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that both people worked on it together at once; one person must test it while another person watches or waits their turn (or vice versa).

### What are some examples of relative clauses?

A relative clause can refer back to either noun or verb in its sentence; however it cannot refer back both ways at once (i.e.; it must choose one direction only). For example: ""The man who",mechanical engineer,0
381,96,The tool designer and the mechanical engineer refined the prototype because she tested the new design.,tool designer,she," tool designer or mechanical engineer.

The answer should be either of these two people; but it could also refer to both of them; which makes sense since they both worked on the project together; so either one could’ve been responsible for testing the new designs. 4) The manager; who was in charge of overseeing the project from start to finish; decided that all employees should receive bonuses at year-end based on their performance during each quarter throughout 2016",tool designer,0
382,96,The tool designer and the mechanical engineer refined the prototype because he tested the new design.,mechanical engineer,he," Tool Designer. This is due to the fact that it would be easier for him to test his own designs than it would be for someone else; such as the Mechanical Engineer; who may not even know how to use them properly in order test them out on their own time without any assistance from others involved in production process itself (such as those who work directly under them).

## What are some examples of ambiguous antecedents?

Ambiguous antecedents",tool designer,0
383,96,The mechanical engineer and the tool designer refined the prototype because he tested the new design.,mechanical engineer,he," mechanical engineer.

384,97,The cybersecurity specialist and the network administrator secured the system because she updated the firewall.,network administrator,she," security specialist.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if it was not her who was updating the firewall; but rather someone else doing it on her behalf. This would make her less responsible; which would make less sense in context of securing the systems. 10 points Question 42 (2 points) Saved Which sentence below uses correct subject-verb agreement?

385,97,The network administrator and the cybersecurity specialist secured the system because she updated the firewall.,network administrator,she," Cybersecurity Specialist. This makes sense as it was her job as part of her role as a security professional; so it was her responsibility to update the firewall; not that of the Network Administrator who would be responsible for other aspects such as maintaining servers or routers on their networks etc..

Gender-neutral language can refer to words that do not specify gender or words which include both genders in",cybersecurity specialist,0
386,97,The network administrator and the cybersecurity specialist secured the system because he updated the firewall.,cybersecurity specialist,he," Network Administrator.

The reason why it’s pointing towards that one; instead of Cyber Security Specialist; is that it says “he” instead of they or them which means it has to be singular which would mean it has to refer back to one person which would make sense since they are both doing something together but only one person can do what was said in the sentence so therefore we know which one did what was said in the sentence by looking at how many people were involved in",network administrator,0
387,97,The cybersecurity specialist and the network administrator secured the system because he updated the firewall.,cybersecurity specialist,he," Network Administrator. This makes sense as it would be his job as part of his role as part of his role in securing systems; so it makes sense that it was him who did it rather than someone else in another department or team in the company.

390,98,The UI designer and the mobile app developer redesigned the interface because he improved user experience.,mobile app developer,he," Mobile App Developer.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely that both people would be responsible for improving UX; so it makes sense to assume one person did all of the work. This makes them both responsible in some way or another but not equally so! You can also use “they” when there are multiple subjects involved but only one object (e). They both worked on improving UX; however only one person actually did anything about improving their product(s). This",mobile app developer,0
