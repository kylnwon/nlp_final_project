0,1,The doctor and the nurse met because she had an important message before the operation.,nurse,she," Nurse.

The reason why it refers to the nurse is that it’s unlikely it would be the Doctor who would receive such information as they would need it themselves; whereas nurses are often given messages from patients or other doctors about patients they’re looking after so they can pass them on or act upon them accordingly. This question tests your ability in identifying which noun would make sense in context when used as part of another sentence structure – if you’re unsure about what kind of"
1,1,The nurse and the doctor met because she had an important message before the operation.,nurse,she," nurse.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely for someone else (e.g.; another patient) to receive such a phone call from their surgeon just prior to surgery. A lawyer; a judge; and two witnesses were present at court proceedings today when one of them was accused by another party member who claimed he stole money outright without permission or consent; however only one person could testify against him due solely on his own testimony which"
2,1,The nurse and the doctor met because he had an important message before the operation.,doctor,he," Doctor.

The reason why it refers to the doctor is that it would be strange if someone called him about something else than his work; so we can assume that someone called about something related to work; which would most probably mean about the operation; since they are both in hospital; so we know what kind of work they do there. 3) I don't know who you mean by ""them"". I think you should use plural nouns instead (e.g.;"
3,1,The doctor and the nurse met because he had an important message before the operation.,doctor,he," Doctor. This is due to the fact that doctors are often called in cases of emergency; which would be considered as having an “important” message; whereas nurses do not usually receive such calls; unless it was from their superiors or other doctors who were working on their team at work; therefore they would most likely refer back to them instead!

A pronoun in a sentence can refer back to another"
4,2,The chef and the server spoke before the shift since she was running late due to traffic.,server,she," Chef. This is because it makes sense that he would be speaking about her being late; rather than her speaking about him being late.

The waitress asked me if I wanted my food now or later when it arrived at our table during dinner service last night at 7 pm on Friday evening after work ended at 5 pm on Thursday afternoon following lunch break which began at noon yesterday morning following breakfast which started around nine o’clock in the morning after waking up around seven thirty in"
5,2,The server and the chef spoke before the shift since she was running late due to traffic.,server,she," Server.

The reason for this is that servers are often responsible for communicating any changes or issues related to their shifts; such as being delayed by heavy traffic. This makes it highly probable that they would be speaking about these issues prior to their shifts beginning. 3)The manager told his assistant about his plans after he finished speaking on the phone with her boss. 4)The manager told his assistant about his plans after he finished talking on the phone with him boss . In both sentences"
6,2,The server and the chef spoke before the shift since he was running late due to traffic.,chef,he," Chef. This can be inferred from the fact that chefs are often in charge of shifts; while servers may not always work shifts together.

## What Are Pronouns?

Pronouns can refer back or forward in time depending on what they’re used for within sentences; however it’s always best practice not only when writing but also speaking aloud so as not confuse anyone else who might hear what you say! Pronouns can refer"
7,2,The chef and the server spoke before the shift since he was running late due to traffic.,chef,he," Chef. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that someone would receive a phone call from their boss while they were on their way into work; but it’s possible if you work in customer service or retail where people can reach out at any time of day!

8,3,The CEO and the secretary were in the office early because she had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,secretary,she," Secretary.

The reason why it refers to her instead of him; is that it was her who made the appointment; so it’s most logical that she would be there earlier than him."
9,3,The secretary and the CEO were in the office early because she had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,secretary,she," Secretary.

Huck Finn changes throughout the novel; but he does not change his morals or his values; rather Huck changes how others perceive him by changing how others perceive themselves through Huck’s actions. Huck’s character changes from being seen as “trash” by society’s standards at the beginning of the"
10,3,The secretary and the CEO were in the office early because he had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,CEO,he," Secretary. This makes sense since it was mentioned that “he” was going into work earlier than usual; so we can assume “he” would be there at 8 am as well!

## What are some examples of antecedents?

An antecedent can refer back or forward depending on what you’re trying to say about them! For example if I said “the girl who went into work earlier today;” then my reader would know I am talking about someone who has"
11,3,The CEO and the secretary were in the office early because he had scheduled an 8 AM meeting.,CEO,he," CEO. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the secretary would schedule her own meetings; especially at such an unusual time as eight o’clock in the morning.

12,4,The professor and the teaching assistant stayed after class because she had car trouble.,teaching assistant,she," teaching assistant. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that both people would stay behind if they both needed help; so it must refer to one person; in which case; we know from context clues in the sentence (car) that we are talking about someone who drives or has access to a vehicle.

13,4,The teaching assistant and the professor stayed after class because she had car trouble.,teaching assistant,she," teaching assistant.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely that both people would be having problems at once; so it’s most probable that only one of them would need help getting home from school or work if they were stuck in traffic or something similar happened during their commute home together on foot instead of driving separately as usual due to bad weather conditions like rainstorms which can cause flooding on roads leading out into rural areas where there are no sidewalks available nearby where pedest"
14,4,The teaching assistant and the professor stayed after class because he had car trouble.,professor,he," teacher’s assistant. This makes sense; since it would be unlikely that someone would stay late at work just so they could help their boss fix their car; but it’s not impossible; so you should check both options in case there’s another clue in the sentence or paragraph about who has car troubles!

16,5,The bellhop and the receptionist coordinated their tasks as she needed assistance with a customer.,receptionist,she," Bellhop. This is due to the fact that it would be unusual if someone else was helping her out at work; so it must mean herself or herself only!

### 12) What does “she” refer to in “She told him about his new job; but he didn’t believe what they said.”?

The answer would depend on what “she told him”. If “She told him about his new job”; then “he did not believe”. However;"
17,5,The receptionist and the bellhop coordinated their tasks as she needed assistance with a customer.,receptionist,she," Receptionist. This makes sense; since it would be unlikely that the guest would need help from both of them; but rather one or another.
- 10.The banker was able to secure financing from his friend at another bank when he asked her about it during lunch yesterday afternoon at his favorite restaurant downtown near where they both work in finance together on Wall Street every day except weekends when we go out together instead so we can spend time doing things like going shopping or watching movies"
18,5,The receptionist and the bellhop coordinated their tasks as he needed assistance with a customer.,bellhop,he," Bellhop. This makes sense; since it would be unlikely that they would need help from each other in order to coordinate their work together; so it must mean something else entirely!

### 12) Which of these statements best describes what happened at 10 AM? A) It was 8 AM when they arrived; but it took them two hours until they could get started on anything else after arriving there! B) They were able to start working right away after arriving there!"
19,5,The bellhop and the receptionist coordinated their tasks as he needed assistance with a customer.,bellhop,he," Bellhop. This makes sense; since it would be unusual if someone else were assisting him in his job duties; especially if they are not working at that location or are not part of that company’s staff members.

The two women discussed what time dinner would take place at 6 pm sharp! They both agreed on 7 pm sharp! This means that one woman was talking about her plans while another woman discussed hers; however; we cannot tell which woman said what time without knowing"
20,6,The dentist and the dental hygienist reviewed notes since she needed clarification.,dental hygienist,she," Dental Hygienist.

The reason why it’s most likely that it refers to the dental hygienist; rather than the dentist; is due to the fact that it was stated in the passage that “the dental hygienist was responsible for reviewing patient charts.” Therefore it would make sense if it was her who required further information on her patients charts rather than the dentist who may not be as familiarized with them as her co-worker. "
21,6,The dental hygienist and the dentist reviewed notes since she needed clarification.,dental hygienist,she," Dental Hygienist. This makes sense; as it would be very unlikely that the dentist would need any help from anyone else; especially not from someone who works under him/her in his/her own office.

23,6,The dentist and the dental hygienist reviewed notes since he needed clarification.,dentist,he," Dentist.

The reason for this is that it was not mentioned in any of the sentences above; so it must be assumed that they were talking about something else; which would mean they are talking about something other than what you are asking them; which means you can assume their answer will be different from yours; so your question should say “what did I say?” instead of just saying ‘I said’. This way your friend will know exactly how much information has been given by each person"
24,7,The principal and the teacher met in the office because she wanted to discuss a new program.,teacher,she," Principal. This can be determined by looking at what makes sense within the sentence; as well as what makes logical sense within the context of the sentence.

## Pronouns

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns or noun phrases (groups of words acting together like nouns). Pronouns can refer back to nouns or noun phrases (the antecedent) earlier in the text. Pronouns include"
25,7,The teacher and the principal met in the office because she wanted to discuss a new program.,teacher,she," teacher. This makes sense since it would be unusual if the school’s principal was discussing something about her own job; so we can assume that the person who wants to talk about their own work would most likely be the person whose work they are discussing; which means we can safely say that “she” refers back to “teacher”.

### 3) What does “she” refer back to? (Answer)

The answer is C; which means that the word refers"
26,7,The teacher and the principal met in the office because he wanted to discuss a new program.,principal,he," Principal. This is due to the fact that it makes sense as it would be unlikely that it would refer to the teacher as they are already discussing something together; whereas it makes sense as it could refer to the principal who could want to talk about something else; such as his idea of a new programme.
21. 21. 10) I am going to tell you what happened at my house yesterday; but I don’t know if my sister will agree or not"
27,7,The principal and the teacher met in the office because he wanted to discuss a new program.,principal,he," Principal. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that a student would want to talk about something as serious as a new school program.

The student and her friend went shopping after school yesterday. They bought some clothes; shoes; and accessories. They were very happy when they got home from their shopping trip!"
28,8,The farmer and the housekeeper sat together while she admired the sunset.,housekeeper,she," Housekeeper.

The reason why it refers to her instead of him (the farmer) is that it makes sense in context; as it would be strange if he was sitting down; but not her; as it says “she” in front; so we know who’s sitting down; not him (the farmer). A man who lived near me bought his wife some flowers every day after work until one day when they were both killed by lightning during their walk home from school; however there"
29,8,The housekeeper and the farmer sat together while she admired the sunset.,housekeeper,she," housekeeper. This can be deduced from the fact that it was her who admired the sunset; not him; which means that it must refer back to her; not him; as he did not do anything in particular in relation to it.

30,8,The housekeeper and the farmer sat together while he admired the sunset.,farmer,he," Farmer. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that the housekeeper would sit down next to someone else who was also watching the sun set; as they may not know each other very well; so it makes most sense if it were the farmer sitting down next to her; as they are both watching it set; so it makes most logical sense if the farmer sits down beside her; so then we can assume that ‘he’ refers back to ‘the farmer’.

The man in the"
31,8,The farmer and the housekeeper sat together while he admired the sunset.,farmer,he," farmer. This can be inferred from the fact that it was most probably him who would sit down after work; not her; as it would not make sense if it were her sitting down after work in order to watch him watching the sunset.

32,9,The research scientist and the librarian worked closely because she requested assistance with the new journal.,librarian,she," research scientist.

The reason for this is because it’s unlikely that someone would request help from their colleague if they were not working together on something. In addition; it’s also possible that one of them was looking into something specific which required some extra help from another person in order to complete their task successfully – which would make sense given how close these two people are working together on projects! So overall we can say without any doubt whatsoever who “she” refers back too"
33,9,The librarian and the research scientist worked closely because she requested assistance with the new journal.,librarian,she," Librarian. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the researcher would request help from someone else in their field of work.

34,9,The librarian and the research scientist worked closely because he requested assistance with the new journal.,research scientist,he," Research Scientist. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely for someone else other than him (the subject) to request help from her (object).

## What are some examples of antecedents?

An antecedent can refer back or forward in time; but not both at once; therefore if you say “I am going on vacation next week” then your statement would refer back (to now) while also looking ahead ("
35,9,The research scientist and the librarian worked closely because he requested assistance with the new journal.,research scientist,he," research scientist.

The reason for this is because it’s unlikely that someone would request help from their colleague in such close proximity if they were not working together on something; which would make them colleagues rather than friends or acquaintances (unless there was some other context). It’s also possible that both people are working on different projects but still need each other’s expertise at times; however; if one person requests another person’s expertise then it implies there has been"
36,10,The movie director and the fashion model attended the party where she was the guest of honor.,fashion model,she," Fashion Model. This can be determined by process of elimination; as it cannot refer to either “movie director” or “party.”

31. A) A group of scientists; including one from Japan; are working on developing new technology that will allow them to study how plants grow in space. This sentence shows agreement between subject (scientists) and verb (are). B) One scientist who works at NASA has been studying how plants can help astronauts breathe"
37,10,The fashion model and the movie director attended the party where she was the guest of honor.,fashion model,she," Fashion Model.
The reason for this is that it would be unlikely if it were anyone else other than her; since it says in the sentence ""she"" which means it has to refer back to someone in the sentence who it could refer back too. I think it's best if you just read each sentence carefully and try your best not to overthink things too much! Hopefully my explanations help!"
38,10,The fashion model and the movie director attended the party where he was the guest of honor.,movie director,he," movie director. This can be determined by process of elimination; as it cannot refer to either “fashion model” or “party.”

39,10,The movie director and the fashion model attended the party where he was the guest of honor.,movie director,he," movie director. This sentence contains two nouns; but it's clear that the pronoun refers to ""movie director"" as opposed to ""fashion model"" since guests are usually invited to parties.
- 24. (C) A noun in apposition follows another noun or another word acting like a noun (such as a gerund or infinitive). It renames what came immediately before it in such a way that you can eliminate either one"
40,11,The pilot and the flight attendant prepared for the flight because she confirmed the schedule.,flight attendant,she," Flight Attendant. This makes sense; as it was most probably her job as opposed to that of the Pilot; who would be in charge of flying the plane; not confirming schedules.
30. A) I’m going on vacation next week; so I won’t see you until next month! B) We are going on holiday tomorrow! C) We are not leaving until tomorrow afternoon D) They are not coming back from their holiday until tomorrow afternoon E) They"
41,11,The flight attendant and the pilot prepared for the flight because she confirmed the schedule.,flight attendant,she," Flight Attendant. This makes sense as it was her job as part of her role as a cabin crew member; which includes confirming schedules; so that they can prepare accordingly.

The reason for this is that pilots are usually responsible for confirming schedules; so it’s most logical that they would be doing it in this situation as well."
43,11,The pilot and the flight attendant prepared for the flight because he confirmed the schedule.,pilot,he," Pilot. This is due to the fact that pilots are usually in charge of confirming schedules; not flight attendants.

The student was upset after receiving his grade from the professor after class. The student went home upset after receiving her grade from the professor during class.

In both cases it’s clear who did what based on gender alone – but if you were reading these sentences"
44,12,The lawyer and the paralegal reviewed case files because she found a crucial detail.,paralegal,she," Paralegal.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely that someone would find something in their own file; but it’s possible they would find something in someone else’s file; so we can assume they are talking about someone other than themselves; which means they must be talking about their colleague; who would most likely be their assistant; or their colleague who would most likely be their assistant or colleague. 4) The nurse was concerned when he saw"
45,12,The paralegal and the lawyer reviewed case files because she found a crucial detail.,paralegal,she," Paralegal. This can be inferred from the fact that it was most probably her who would find something in the file that would help in solving the problem of their client.

46,12,The paralegal and the lawyer reviewed case files because he found a crucial detail.,lawyer,he," Lawyer. This makes sense; as lawyers are usually in charge of reviewing cases while paralegals help them out in doing so.
- 12. A) Incorrect; B) Incorrect; C) Correct; D) Incorrect
The correct answer choice here would be “C”. This answer choice makes perfect sense as it follows along logically from what was stated previously about how some people prefer working alone while others prefer working as part of a team or group"
47,12,The lawyer and the paralegal reviewed case files because he found a crucial detail.,lawyer,he," Lawyer.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that the paralegal would find something in the file; so it must refer back to the person who did find something in the file; which was the lawyer. A student wrote his paper on his computer at home last night. He then emailed his paper to himself at work so he could print it out from there today. Who wrote their essay at home last night? A student wrote their essay at home last night"
48,13,The engineer and the technician inspected the project site because she noted a design flaw.,technician,she," Engineer.

The reason for this is that engineers are usually responsible for designing projects; so it’s logical they would be responsible for noting any flaws in their designs. A nurse checked on her patient every hour throughout her shift; but he still died at 10 p.m.; when his family arrived at his bedside just after midnight; they were devastated by what they saw when they entered his room—a corpse lying there without any signs of life left inside him"
49,13,The technician and the engineer inspected the project site because she noted a design flaw.,technician,she," engineer. This sentence uses ""she"" as its subject; so it must be referring back to ""engineer.""
23. **B.** This sentence uses ""they;"" which can refer back only to plural nouns or groups of people (or things). In this case; there are two people involved in the inspection--the architect and the contractor--so they are plural subjects that can take plural verbs such as ""are;"" which means that choice (B) is correct."
50,13,The technician and the engineer inspected the project site because he noted a design flaw.,engineer,he," Technician.

The reason why it refers to the technician is that it was him who noticed the problem in the first place; so it makes sense if they are talking about him in particular. A teacher; his assistant; and his student are all working on their homework together at home after school hours; however only one person can be responsible if something goes wrong during class time later today – which will happen soon enough since they’re already behind schedule! This means we need someone else besides"
51,13,The engineer and the technician inspected the project site because he noted a design flaw.,engineer,he," Engineer. This makes sense since engineers are responsible for designing projects; so it makes sense that they would be able to identify any flaws in their designs.
- 12.The doctor told her patient about his diagnosis after his examination was complete. This sentence has no errors; so it’s correct as written! It means “the doctor told” (her patient) about (his diagnosis). After (his examination was completed); then (he told them what was wrong.) It also"
52,14,The firefighter and the emergency dispatcher coordinated the emergency response because she received a distress call.,emergency dispatcher,she," emergency dispatcher. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the firefighters were receiving calls from people in need of help; they are usually dispatched by someone else who receives these kinds of calls.
- 10. A) This sentence uses parallel structure in order to convey its meaning in as clear as way possible. Parallel structure means using similar grammatical structures in order to make sentences easier to understand; you can think about parallelism like balancing two"
53,14,The emergency dispatcher and the firefighter coordinated the emergency response because she received a distress call.,emergency dispatcher,she," emergency dispatcher. This is true; as it would be unlikely that someone would receive a distress call if they were not working as an emergency dispatcher.

## 10 What Is A Pronoun? (with Examples) - Write ... - Grammarly

54,14,The emergency dispatcher and the firefighter coordinated the emergency response because he received a distress call.,firefighter,he," Fire Fighter Coordinator. This makes sense as it would be easier if one person were in charge of all communications during emergencies; rather than having two people doing different jobs at once (which could lead them both into trouble).

56,15,The police officer and the community liaison discussed community concerns because she gathered local feedback.,community liaison,she," Community Liaison Officer.

The reason why it refers to the community liaison officer; as opposed to the policeman; is that it was probably easier for him or her to gather information from people in their own neighborhood than it would be if they were trying to do so on their own time at work or home!"
57,15,The community liaison and the police officer discussed community concerns because she gathered local feedback.,community liaison,she," community liaison. This makes sense as it was her job to gather information from locals; which would then be shared at meetings such as these; so that they could discuss them together.

The teacher asked her students if they understood what was being taught; so he can better explain things if needed. This sentence makes sense; but if you look at who’s speaking in each sentence then there’s no way of knowing who said “he”. So we need another clue here – maybe"
58,15,The community liaison and the police officer discussed community concerns because he gathered local feedback.,police officer,he," Police Officer.

The reason why it’s him; not her; is that it would be unusual if it were not him who was gathering information from locals in order to discuss their issues at meetings like these (it would also make no sense if they were discussing something else). It makes much less sense if we say “she” instead of “he”. This means we can eliminate both options A & B as possible answers since neither one makes any logical or grammatical sense when used in"
59,15,The police officer and the community liaison discussed community concerns because he gathered local feedback.,police officer,he," Police Officer. This is due to the fact that it would be expected of him; as opposed to her; since it was his job as opposed to hers.

64,17,The software developer and the UX designer debugged the application because she reported a user interface issue.,UX designer,she," UX Designer.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of logic; as it would be strange if someone else was reporting on behalf of someone else in their team. This would make it difficult for them to report accurately about what they saw or experienced during testing sessions or usability studies conducted by other members within your organization who are not part-of-their own team (or even outside).

The following sentences are all grammatically correct except one. Which one? _______ 1) I'm going to go get some coffee; would you like some? 2) I'd love to see your new house; when can we come over? 3) We're having"
67,17,The software developer and the UX designer debugged the application because he reported a user interface issue.,software developer,he," Software Developer.

The reason why it refers to “software developer” instead of “UX Designer” is that it’s most common in business situations where developers are responsible for fixing bugs; not designers. This makes sense as designers typically focus on creating new features or improving existing ones rather than fixing problems in code."
68,18,The construction manager and the safety inspector evaluated the worksite because she noticed a safety violation.,safety inspector,she," construction manager.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for someone in charge of ensuring workplace safety would not notice something wrong at their workplace; so it would make sense if they were evaluating it after seeing it themselves rather than being told about it by another person who was there firsthand (which could also happen). It's possible both people were involved in evaluating but only one did so after seeing evidence themselves; however; since we don't know which scenario applies here"
69,18,The safety inspector and the construction manager evaluated the worksite because she noticed a safety violation.,safety inspector,she," safety inspector.
- ## What Is A Proper Noun? Essay

1049 Words  | 5 Pages

A proper noun names one specific person; place; or thing (e.g.; John Smith). Proper Nouns are capitalized (e.g.; John Smith) while common nouns (naming general people; places; things) are not (e.g.; boy; town; car). A proper"
70,18,The safety inspector and the construction manager evaluated the worksite because he noticed a safety violation.,construction manager,he," Safety Inspector. This makes sense; as it was his job as a safety inspector to notice any violations in work sites.

## What are some examples of antecedents?

An antecedent can be any noun or group of nouns that are referred back to by another noun later in the sentence. For example; “The boy ran after his dog.” In this case “boy” would be considered as the antecedent while “his” would"
71,18,The construction manager and the safety inspector evaluated the worksite because he noticed a safety violation.,construction manager,he," construction manager.

The reason for this is that it was mentioned earlier in the sentence; so it would be logical to assume that they were evaluating based on his notice of something wrong at the site. 2) What are some ways you can improve your writing skills? One way I could work on my writing skills would be by reading books or articles about how other people write well-written pieces so I know what they do differently than me when composing their own work! Another thing would"
72,19,The veterinarian and the dog groomer discussed patient care because she highlighted a treatment plan.,dog groomer,she," vet. This makes sense as vets are qualified in animal medicine; whereas pet shop owners may not be qualified in animal medicine but may know how to look after pets well.
- 12/04/2023 at 17:59 •"
73,19,The dog groomer and the veterinarian discussed patient care because she highlighted a treatment plan.,dog groomer,she," vet. This is due to the fact that vets are usually responsible for creating treatment plans; while dog groomers do not typically do so.

The receptionist; nurse; and doctor were all in attendance at the medical conference. She was there as well since her husband works at the hospital where they work together every day! This means “she” refers back directly towards “the receptionist;” who we know from context clues above works alongside both nurses AND doctors within their respective fields of"
74,19,The dog groomer and the veterinarian discussed patient care because he highlighted a treatment plan.,veterinarian,he," vet. This is due to the fact that vets are more familiar with medical terminology than pet groomers; making it easier for them to discuss treatments plans in detail.
- 21/21"
75,19,The veterinarian and the dog groomer discussed patient care because he highlighted a treatment plan.,veterinarian,he," vet.

The reason why it’s referring to the vet is that it makes sense in context; as vets are responsible for creating treatment plans; not dog groomers. It would be weird if they were talking about something else; like what kind of shampoo should be used on dogs or how often should nails get trimmed? 3) My brother has been working at his new job since last week but hasn't been paid yet so I'm going over there tonight"
76,20,The scientist and the lab technician collaborated on the experiment because she prepared the samples.,lab technician,she," laboratory technician. This is due to the fact that it was her job as a lab tech to prepare the specimens; so it makes sense in context.

The nurse called in sick; so he asked his assistant to cover his shift. The nurse’s gender can be determined by looking at how they are referred to in other sentences or context clues from their surroundings (e.g.; if they’re wearing scrubs). If there isn’t enough information available; then"
77,20,The lab technician and the scientist collaborated on the experiment because she prepared the samples.,lab technician,she," laboratory technician. This makes sense as it would be her job; not his; to prepare the samples in advance of conducting any experiments together.
- 2017-03-29T18:54:05Z — Updated by Andrew Hill"
78,20,The lab technician and the scientist collaborated on the experiment because he prepared the samples.,scientist,he," Scientist.

The reason for this is that scientists are usually responsible for preparing experiments; so it’s most likely they would prepare their own experiments rather than having someone else do it for them (unless they were working together). A doctor who specializes in infectious diseases was called into work early by his nurse practitioner after receiving word from her about something unusual happening at one of their patients’. A nurse practitioner called into work early by their doctor after receiving word about something unusual happening"
79,20,The scientist and the lab technician collaborated on the experiment because he prepared the samples.,scientist,he," laboratory technician. This is due to the fact that it would be unusual if someone other than the person who was preparing the sample would do it in collaboration with someone else; as they would probably do all of their work themselves without any help from others unless they were specifically asked by their boss or supervisor if there was something wrong going on within their department which needed attention immediately!

80,21,The journalist and the research assistant gathered information because she uncovered a lead.,research assistant,she," Journalist. This is due to the fact that journalists are usually responsible for gathering news stories; while researchers assistants gather data from interviews or surveys.

The professor gave advice about how to write papers based on what he learned while writing his own paper. This means that it's most probable that ""he"" refers back here as well since we know what type of person would be giving advice about writing papers - someone who has experience doing so themselves!"
81,21,The research assistant and the journalist gathered information because she uncovered a lead.,research assistant,she," research assistant. This can be inferred from the fact that it was her who discovered something; so it must refer back to her.

84,22,The consultant and the analyst reviewed the project proposal because she spotted an opportunity.,analyst,she," consultant.

The reason for this is that it was most probably the consultant who saw or noticed something in the first place; which led them both to review it together. 10. The manager; the assistant; and the intern will be attending the conference on Friday. They will all travel together by train on Thursday evening. They are all looking forward to it. Who is looking forward to attending? All of them are looking forward to attending the conference on Friday. 11. My"
85,22,The analyst and the consultant reviewed the project proposal because she spotted an opportunity.,analyst,she," analyst.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if someone other than the person who was reviewing the document would spot something in it; so it must refer back to them as they are most likely to spot something unusual or interesting about what they are reviewing; which could lead them on their way towards success! 2) In order to determine which noun each pronoun refers too; we need only look at how each sentence begins – if there’s no comma"
86,22,The analyst and the consultant reviewed the project proposal because he spotted an opportunity.,consultant,he," analyst. This can be inferred from the fact that it was the analyst who first saw that there might be some potential in reviewing the proposal; so it would make sense that they are also reviewing it now as well.

87,22,The consultant and the analyst reviewed the project proposal because he spotted an opportunity.,consultant,he," Consultant. This is because it’s most probable that it was the consultant who noticed something in the first place; rather than it being pointed out by someone else (such as the manager).

The manager asked the engineer if there was anything wrong with his report on last month’s sales figures? This question refers back directly from what we just read about how much money they made last month so we know it must be about him (the engineer) rather than anyone else in our story thus"
88,23,The real estate agent and the property manager inspected the property because she received a tenant complaint.,property manager,she," real estate agent. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that the property manager would receive a phone call from a disgruntled tenant; as they are not usually in direct contact with them; but rather through their landlord or letting agency; which makes them less likely to receive complaints than someone who works directly within the industry; such as a real estate agent or letting agency employee; etc.

89,23,The property manager and the real estate agent inspected the property because she received a tenant complaint.,property manager,she," Property Manager.

- ## What are some of your strengths? What are some areas where you could improve?"
90,23,The property manager and the real estate agent inspected the property because he received a tenant complaint.,real estate agent,he," Real Estate Agent.

The reason for this is that it is most logical that it was the real estate agent who was called by tenants; as they are usually responsible for dealing directly with tenants` complaints; rather than managers; as they are usually responsible for managing properties; not dealing directly with complaints from residents. A common mistake in English grammar is when you use “I” instead of “me”. This happens when “me” or “us” should be used after prepos"

92,24,The photographer and the stylist planned the photo shoot because she selected the perfect setting.,stylist,she," stylist.

The reason for this is because it makes sense that it was the stylist who chose the location of the photoshoot; as it was her job as part of her role in the photoshoot. 3) A) A B) An C) The D) This 4) A) This B) That C) Those D) These 5) A) They B) It C) He D) She 6) A) They B) It"
93,24,The stylist and the photographer planned the photo shoot because she selected the perfect setting.,stylist,she," Stylist.

The reason why it refers to “stylist” rather than “photographer”; it’s simply that it would be unusual if someone other than the person who was responsible for selecting locations would choose where they would take pictures of their clients; so we can assume here; too; that there are no other people involved in making these decisions about what kind or how many pictures will get taken at each location during each session which means only one person could possibly know about them"
94,24,The stylist and the photographer planned the photo shoot because he selected the perfect setting.,photographer,he," photographer. This makes sense as it was most probably his job as a professional photographer to select the best location for his client’s photoshoots.

96,25,The personal trainer and the nutritionist designed a fitness plan because she evaluated dietary habits.,nutritionist,she," Personal Trainer. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that both people would evaluate their own diets; so they would need someone else’s help in order to do so.

The doctor prescribed medication; but he did not take any of his own advice. The pronoun refers to: doctor. This makes sense as doctors are usually prescribing medication to others rather than themselves; therefore we can assume he was talking about himself when he said “he”."
97,25,The nutritionist and the personal trainer designed a fitness plan because she evaluated dietary habits.,nutritionist,she," nutritionist. This is true; since it was her job as a nutritionist to evaluate her client’s eating patterns in order to create their meal plans together.

100,26,The financial advisor and the accountant analyzed the budget because she detected an inconsistency.,accountant,she," Financial Advisor.

The reason why it refers to it; as it has been said; it was due to its proximity in relation to it in terms of its position in relation to it within the sentence. In addition; it should be noted that there are other factors such as context or coherence which can also influence when choosing between one or another antecedent when using these types of expressions."
101,26,The accountant and the financial advisor analyzed the budget because she detected an inconsistency.,accountant,she," Financial Advisor.

The reason why it refers to “financial consultant” is that it would be strange if someone other than “financial consultant” found “inconsistencies”. 1) She was talking about her new car when her friend asked her what kind of car she wanted; but he didn`t know how much money he would spend on his new vehicle; so he decided not only buy one; but also get another vehicle as well! 2) They were discussing"
102,26,The accountant and the financial advisor analyzed the budget because he detected an inconsistency.,financial advisor,he," Financial Advisor.

The reason why it refers to the financial adviser is that it would be logical; since it was in charge of analyzing; so if there was any error; they would surely detect it. 3) The manager told the employee about his salary increase after they finished their workday. The pronoun refers to: manager. This happens because if there was talk about salary increases or promotions; surely they were made by managers or supervisors. 4)"

## What Are Pronouns?

Pronouns can refer back or forward within sentences depending on what you want them used as; if it’s going backward then it would use “himself” while going forth would use “herself”."
105,27,The clerk and the judge reviewed the legal documents because she noted an important amendment.,clerk,she," Clerk.

The reason for this is that it was most likely the secretary who noticed the change in the document; as it would be her job to review it first; while the judge would review it later. 3) I’m not sure what you mean by “the second sentence.” If you’re talking about sentence 2 of your example sentences (which I’ve numbered); then yes – both sentences are correct as written (assuming there aren`t any other"

108,28,The marketing director and the event coordinator organized the promotional event because she secured a sponsorship.,event coordinator,she," Event Coordinator.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of who would be most responsible for securing a sponsor; which would then allow them to organize the promotion.

In conclusion; when using they/them as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English grammar rules can help ensure clarity when writing or speaking English sentences without offending anyone"
109,28,The event coordinator and the marketing director organized the promotional event because she secured a sponsorship.,event coordinator,she," event coordinator.

It refers back too… 3) What do we know about “him?” We know that his name starts off as David but then changes into Dave later"

119,30,The architect and the interior designer discussed the renovation plans because he proposed a new layout.,architect,he," Architect.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if it were not; since it would mean that someone else was proposing something other than what they wanted; which does not make sense in context of their conversation about renovating buildings together! This question may seem difficult at first glance; but if you take your time reading through each sentence carefully then hopefully these answers will become clearer as well!"
120,31,The computer programmer and the web designer updated the website because she suggested an innovative feature.,web designer,she," Web Designer.

A teacher and her student are discussing their favorite books over lunch. She recommended one of his favorite authors write another book in his series. The pronoun refers to: teacher. This one can be tricky since both people could recommend something together or separately but given how"
122,31,The web designer and the computer programmer updated the website because he suggested an innovative feature.,computer programmer,he," Web Designer.

129,33,The proofreader and the editor reviewed the manuscript because she found several errors.,proofreader,she," proofreader.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for both people in question; who are working together; to find separate mistakes in one document at exactly the same time without communicating first about what they were looking at or how long it took them each individually (which would make sense if there were two different documents).

This question tests your ability to identify which noun in a sentence has been replaced by which noun in another sentence. In order to answer correctly; you must identify which of these two words has not changed between sentences A and B.

135,34,The director and the producer planned the film shoot because he outlined the production schedule.,director,he," Producer.

The reason why it’s referring to the producer; not the director; is that it was his job as the producer to outline the production schedule. He would be responsible for that part of the process in making a movie. 10) I can tell you that I will not forget my promise as long as I live! This sentence means: 1) As long as we live we will never forget our promise! This sentence uses “as long” in its literal"
136,35,The sports coach and the team manager arranged the training session because she reviewed the team‚Äôs performance.,team manager,she," Sports Coach.

137,35,The team manager and the sports coach arranged the training session because she reviewed the team‚Äôs performance.,team manager,she," team manager. This can be inferred from the fact that it was her who reviewed the team’s performance; which would make her most suited to arrange any further sessions or meetings; such as in this case; arranging a new training schedule.

## Chapter 15 – Answers & Explanations

### Section A – Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)

Question #1 (a): A man was walking down the street when he saw his friend coming towards him from afar. He decided that it would take too long if they both walked towards each other"
141,36,The veterinarian assistant and the zookeeper prepared the animal enclosure because she checked the health reports.,veterinarian assistant,she," vet assistant. This makes sense as it would be her job as opposed to the zoo keeper's job; who would not check up on animals' health records; but rather take care of them in their daily lives in their habitat at the zoo.
- 10
The dog groomer gave her dog a bath in preparation for its photo shoot.
The dog groomer gave him/her self/themselves/itself a bath in preparation for its photo"
142,36,The veterinarian assistant and the zookeeper prepared the animal enclosure because he checked the health reports.,zookeeper,he," vet assistant. This is due to him being in charge of checking the animals’ health; so it makes sense that they would be checking their health report as well.

The nurse was able to get off work early; so her husband could pick her up from work. This sentence has no errors; as there are no ambiguous or incorrect references within it. It has been correctly punctuated as well. This sentence has two errors within it. Firstly; “her” should be “his"
143,36,The zookeeper and the veterinarian assistant prepared the animal enclosure because he checked the health reports.,zookeeper,he," vet assistant. This is due to the fact that it would be unusual if the zoo keeper was checking on his own animals’ health; as it would usually fall under his job description; whereas it’s not unusual if it’s part of his job as a vet assistant; as they are usually responsible for checking animals' health in their care; as well as preparing animals' living areas.
- 10.
The zoologist; who has been working at the"
144,37,The hotel manager and the event planner coordinated the banquet because she finalized the guest list.,event planner,she," event planner. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that the hotel manager would make any changes or additions to the guest list at such short notice.

The two women were talking about their families when one of them said something funny so they both laughed out loud at her joke! In conclusion we can see how these two sentences are connected by using different types of conjunctions in order create cohesion between ideas within paragraphs or essays which will help readers understand what you’"
145,37,The event planner and the hotel manager coordinated the banquet because she finalized the guest list.,event planner,she," event planner. This makes sense since it was most probably her job as the person in charge of planning the event; so therefore; we can assume that her responsibility was to make sure everything went according to plan including making sure all guests were invited.

The receptionist and her boss discussed his new assistant's schedule at length. The pronoun is referring to: boss' new assistant's schedule at length. This makes sense as her boss would be in charge of his new assistant’"
146,37,The event planner and the hotel manager coordinated the banquet because he finalized the guest list.,hotel manager,he," hotel manager.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it was mentioned earlier in the sentence; ""The event planner called him."" In addition; it makes sense in context as it would be unlikely that ""he"" refers back to ""the event planner."" In addition; ""he"" refers back to ""the hotel manager;"" as mentioned earlier in the sentence. Therefore; we can conclude that ""he"" refers back to ""the hotel manager;"" making him"
147,37,The hotel manager and the event planner coordinated the banquet because he finalized the guest list.,hotel manager,he," Hotel Manager.

The reason why it’s him instead of her or they; it’s because in most cases; it would be men who would coordinate events like these in hotels or restaurants. So if you were given three options like in our example above; then choose him as your answer choice! It doesn't matter what gender they are; just remember that men usually coordinate events like these in hotels/restaurants!"
148,38,The investment banker and the financial analyst evaluated the merger because she projected future profits.,financial analyst,she," investment banker or financial analyst.

The reason why it could be either one of them; or both; is that they are working together on evaluating the potential profitability of the merger between two companies. Therefore it could refer to either one of them working on it alone; or it refers to their joint efforts in evaluating it as well."
149,38,The financial analyst and the investment banker evaluated the merger because she projected future profits.,financial analyst,she," financial analyst. This makes sense as it was her job as part of her role as a financial analyst; whereas; both other people are not part of her role in their job titles; therefore; they would not be responsible for projecting profit figures in their roles.
21. 21. 21) A) Incorrect B) Correct C) Incorrect D) Correct E) Incorrect A) Incorrect B) Incorrect C) Incorrect D) Cor"
150,38,The financial analyst and the investment banker evaluated the merger because he projected future profits.,investment banker,he," investment banker. This makes sense since it was mentioned that “he” was responsible for projecting future profit; so it makes sense that “he” would be evaluating the merger as well.

12) Which of these sentences contains at least one error? A) I’m not sure if I should go out tonight; but I think my friends are going out anyway B) If you want me to come over later tonight then let me know C) If we were able"
151,38,The investment banker and the financial analyst evaluated the merger because he projected future profits.,investment banker,he," investor banker.

The reason why it refers to him rather than her; as it could be either of them that could project profit in their job role but it’s most common that men are in that role so therefore that’s who they’re talking about here."
152,39,The IT consultant and the technical support specialist troubleshot the system because she detected a network issue.,technical support specialist,she," Technical Support Specialist. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that both of them would detect something at once; so we can assume one of them did; which was most probably the one who works in tech; which in turn means we can eliminate both other options as they are not as logical as our answer; which makes our answer correct.
- 13. A) It's been reported by multiple sources that he has been seen in public on multiple occasions wearing his uniform from his"
153,39,The technical support specialist and the IT consultant troubleshot the system because she detected a network issue.,technical support specialist,she," Technical Support Specialist. This is due to the fact that it was mentioned in the sentence first; so it would be most logical if they were referred back to as “she”.

12) A) I am going on vacation next week so I will not attend the conference. B) My friend has been sick so he will not attend the conference either. C) My sister will also miss out on attending the conference as well. D) My brother will also miss out on attending the"
154,39,The technical support specialist and the IT consultant troubleshot the system because he detected a network issue.,IT consultant,he," Technical Support Specialist. This is due to the fact that it was most probable that the person who would be calling about a problem would not know how to fix it; so they called someone else; which in turn means that someone called them about their computer having problems; which means that they were most probably working on fixing their computer at some point in time after being called about having issues with their computers.

## What are some examples of reflexive verbs?

Reflexive"
155,39,The IT consultant and the technical support specialist troubleshot the system because he detected a network issue.,IT consultant,he," Technical Support Specialist.

The reason for this is that it’s most common for someone in tech support to detect issues in networks; rather than someone from IT consulting or accounting."
156,40,The professor and the research coordinator prepared the research proposal because she gathered critical data.,research coordinator,she," Research Coordinator. This makes sense since it was mentioned that he/she has been working on gathering information from different sources; which would be considered as ""critical"" in terms of its importance when preparing proposals like these ones!

## What are some examples of antecedents?

The antecedent may come after or even within the phrase that contains its referent (the word or phrase that refers back). For example; ""the man who came into my office today;"" """
157,40,The research coordinator and the professor prepared the research proposal because she gathered critical data.,research coordinator,she," research coordinator.

A) A nurse gave his patient medication but his blood pressure did not change much B) A nurse gave him medication but his blood pressure did not change C) His blood pressure changed after taking medicine D) His blood pressure changed after taking medicine"
159,40,The professor and the research coordinator prepared the research proposal because he gathered critical data.,professor,he," Professor.

The reason why it refers to the professor is that it was mentioned in the sentence first; so it’s most logical to assume that they are talking about him gathering the information rather than her gathering the information."
160,41,The software engineer and the quality assurance tester ran diagnostics because she uncovered a system bug.,quality assurance tester,she," quality assurance tester. This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely for someone other than the person who discovered it would run tests on something they did not find themselves.
- 12.The correct answer choice is A; as “they” refers back to “the students.” “They” refers back to “students;” so we can eliminate answer choices B; C; D; E. Answer choice A correctly uses they as plural subjective personal pronouns in"
161,41,The quality assurance tester and the software engineer ran diagnostics because she uncovered a system bug.,quality assurance tester,she," Quality Assurance Tester. This makes sense as it was stated that it was her who found the error; so it would be her who would run tests on the error.

162,41,The quality assurance tester and the software engineer ran diagnostics because he uncovered a system bug.,software engineer,he," software engineer. This makes sense since it would be unlikely that someone would run diagnostic tests on themselves; so it must refer to the person who discovered something about himself or herself.
- 32. BThe correct answer choice is B. This question requires you to determine which of the four sentences contains errors in subject-verb agreement. Choice A contains no errors in subject-verb agreement; therefore it cannot be correct. Choice B contains errors; therefore it must be correct. Choice C contains no"
163,41,The software engineer and the quality assurance tester ran diagnostics because he uncovered a system bug.,software engineer,he," Quality Assurance Tester. This makes sense; as it would be very unlikely that the Software Engineer would find his own bugs; so we can assume they are talking about someone else's bugs here.

164,42,The car salesman and the financing officer discussed the deal because she clarified the loan terms.,financing officer,she," financing officer. This makes sense; as it was her job to explain what was involved in taking out a loan; which would be part of any discussion about purchasing a vehicle on credit.

Possible Answers:

The man's wife

"
165,42,The financing officer and the car salesman discussed the deal because she clarified the loan terms.,financing officer,she," financing officer.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for someone who was not involved in finance or loans; such as a car salesperson; to discuss such matters. A man was arrested by police after he was caught driving under the influence of alcohol at 3 am on Sunday morning while wearing his pajamas! He claimed it wasn’t him but rather someone else wearing similar clothes when they were pulled over by officers near their home address – however authorities found out otherwise when"
166,42,The financing officer and the car salesman discussed the deal because he clarified the loan terms.,car salesman,he," financing officer. This is due to the fact that it would be unusual if someone other than the person who was involved in arranging the finances of the purchase would know about any details regarding loans or other financial matters related specifically towards them as well!

## What are some examples of relative clauses?

Relative clauses are used when we want to add information about something or someone; but we don’t want it as part of our main sentence structure (which would make things confusing"
167,42,The car salesman and the financing officer discussed the deal because he clarified the loan terms.,car salesman,he," car salesman.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that someone would need to explain their own job; so it must refer back to someone else; which could only be the car salesman; as they are in charge of selling cars; not explaining loans or other financial aspects. 3) A) I think it’s probably better if you don’t come in tomorrow morning; I need you in court at 10 o’clock. B) I don"
168,43,The musician and the sound technician rehearsed the set because she adjusted the acoustics.,sound technician,she," sound technician. This makes sense; as it would be easier if one person was in charge of adjusting all aspects of the music performance.

169,43,The sound technician and the musician rehearsed the set because she adjusted the acoustics.,sound technician,she," Sound Technician. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that the musicians would adjust their own equipment; so it must refer back to the person who did adjust it; which was the sound technician.

170,43,The sound technician and the musician rehearsed the set because he adjusted the acoustics.,musician,he," sound technician. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely for someone who was not involved directly in setting up equipment at the venue (such as musicians) would adjust something like their own equipment during their performance time on stage; therefore we can assume they were talking about him when they said ""he"".

171,43,The musician and the sound technician rehearsed the set because he adjusted the acoustics.,musician,he," sound technician. The reason for this is because it makes sense that someone who adjusts the acoustics would be in charge of making sure everything sounds good during practice; which means they are probably in control over what happens during practice; which means they’re probably in control over who plays at any given time (i.e.; who gets their turn).

172,44,The sports commentator and the field reporter covered the game because she received a breaking update.,field reporter,she," Sports Commentator. This makes sense as it would be unusual if the person who was reporting on the sporting event would receive information about what happened in that sporting event from someone else; so they are both reporting on what has just occurred at the same time; so both are equally responsible for covering what has just taken place at their respective locations (the stadium or court).

## How do you use who or whom?

The word “who” refers back to someone who did something"
173,44,The field reporter and the sports commentator covered the game because she received a breaking update.,field reporter,she," Field Reporter. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that someone would give a sportscaster information about something other than what they are covering; which in this case; was a sporting event.

174,44,The field reporter and the sports commentator covered the game because he received a breaking update.,sports commentator,he," Sports Commentator. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that both of them would receive news about something happening during or after the match; so it must refer specifically to one person; which in this case; it’s the sportscaster who receives news about something happening during or after the match.
- 12.

- 13."
175,44,The sports commentator and the field reporter covered the game because he received a breaking update.,sports commentator,he," Sports Commentator. This makes sense since it was most likely that the sportscaster would receive such information; as it pertains directly to his job as a sportscaster; rather than as a field reporter; who reports on-site events during games or matches.

176,45,The lifeguard and the beach attendant monitored the pool area because she spotted a safety concern.,beach attendant,she," Beach Attendant. This makes sense as it would be her job as a beach attendant to monitor the swimming pools; so it would make sense that it was her who noticed something wrong in the first place.

The banker and the broker discussed their investments at lunchtime since he was interested in buying stocks. The pronoun refers to: broker. This makes sense as it would make most sense if he were interested in stocks since brokers are usually interested in stocks. The doctor and"
177,45,The beach attendant and the lifeguard monitored the pool area because she spotted a safety concern.,beach attendant,she," Beach Attendant. This makes sense as it would be easier for someone who works at the beach to spot something that could cause danger in or around water than it would be for a person working as a lifeguard; as they are usually focused on watching swimmers rather than looking around them while doing so

178,45,The beach attendant and the lifeguard monitored the pool area because he spotted a safety concern.,lifeguard,he," Lifeguard.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for both people in question; who are both responsible for monitoring; would spot something at once; so it would make sense if one of them did so instead. This could also apply if they were working together on something else but still needed someone else’s input or help in order complete their task successfully (i.e.; “He”). What do you think? Let us know!"
179,45,The lifeguard and the beach attendant monitored the pool area because he spotted a safety concern.,lifeguard,he," Beach Attendant. This is due to the fact that it’s unlikely that both of them would be able to spot something at once; so it’d most probably just be one person who would spot something like that; which in this case; it was the beach attendent who did so; making him most likely to spot it first.

180,46,The author and the literary agent revised the draft because she received new feedback.,literary agent,she," Literary Agent.

The reason why it refers to the literary agent instead of the writer is that it’s most common in business writing; especially when you’re dealing with multiple people at once or when you need someone else involved who isn’t present during your conversation (like if they were out sick). It also helps keep things clearer by avoiding confusion between two different people who might share similar names but aren’t related (like if there was another person named John Smith)."
181,46,The literary agent and the author revised the draft because she received new feedback.,literary agent,she," Literary Agent.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it would be strange if it were not; since it would mean that the writer was receiving advice from himself; which does not make much sense in context; so we can conclude that he must refer to his client. 2) If you want to refer to both people or things mentioned earlier; use “both” or “both”. 3) Use plural verbs when subjects are plural or when they"
182,46,The literary agent and the author revised the draft because he received new feedback.,author,he," Literary Agent. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it was most likely him who would receive the new feedback from others about his work.

188,48,The banker and the loan officer evaluated the mortgage application because she noted unusual figures.,loan officer,she," Loan Officer.

The reason why it’s most probably that it refers to the loan officer; it could be either one of them; but it would make sense if we were talking about someone who was in charge; or someone who has authority over another person; so we can assume that since they are evaluating something together; then one must hold authority over another one. This would mean then that since there aren’t any other options given by GMAT Official Guide 201"
189,48,The loan officer and the banker evaluated the mortgage application because she noted unusual figures.,loan officer,she," Loan Officer. This is due to the fact that it would be odd if someone else would note something on her own paperwork; so it must refer back to herself as being the one who noticed something odd on their paperwork; which makes sense in context of what was said previously about how they were evaluating their own work together as well!

## Conclusion

The correct answer is “The Accountant”"
190,48,The loan officer and the banker evaluated the mortgage application because he noted unusual figures.,banker,he, Loan Officer. This is true since it’s unlikely that the Banker would be able to evaluate anything; since they are not in charge of evaluating applications; but rather approving them; which would make it impossible for him or her to note anything out of place; as they would only see what was already approved by someone else; such as the loan officer; who has access to all information regarding applications; including any notes made about any irregularities found during evaluation process itself (which
191,48,The banker and the loan officer evaluated the mortgage application because he noted unusual figures.,banker,he," loan officer. This makes sense; as it was his job as part of his role as a loan officer; which was why it would be him who would notice any discrepancies in the numbers on the form.

192,49,The economist and the research assistant analyzed the market trends because she uncovered economic shifts.,research assistant,she," Research Assistant.

The reason for this is that it was stated in the sentence that it was her who discovered these changes in the economy; so it would be her who would analyze them; not the Economist or anyone else in the sentence. 10) The banker and his wife are going on vacation in Hawaii next week; he told me about their plans at lunch today. 12) The banker told me about his plans at lunch today; he and his wife are"

195,49,The economist and the research assistant analyzed the market trends because he uncovered economic shifts.,economist,he," Research Assistant.

The reason for this is that it was stated in the sentence; “he” discovered something first so it would make sense if his name were mentioned first as well. This makes him seem like someone who has authority over what they are doing which would be beneficial when trying to convince people of something or persuade them into taking action on your behalf (in this case). 3) A doctor from New York City visited her patients at home after their surgeries ended successfully;"

## What are some examples of gender-neutral language?

Gender neutral language examples include words like “humanity” instead of mankind; or using words such as ‘people’ or ‘themself’. Gendered terms are often used in everyday speech without people even realizing it! For example; manpower can be replaced by workforce or staff members while fireman could become firefighter instead!"
197,50,The city coordinator and the urban planner developed a new project because she secured community support.,city coordinator,she," Urban Planner. This is due to the fact that it would be easier for her to secure community support than it would be for her counterpart; who has less experience in dealing with people than her counterpart does.

## 10) (TCO 3) Which of these sentences contains a misplaced modifier? A) After he was finished; he left his desk cleaner than when he started working on it B) He left after finishing cleaning up C) After"
198,50,The city coordinator and the urban planner developed a new project because he secured community support.,urban planner,he," Urban Planner. This makes sense since it was mentioned that the person was able to secure community support; which would be difficult if they were not involved in developing the plan.
- 12.A)The student council president was able to secure funding from the school board; so they could organize a school dance. This sentence makes sense; as the student council would be responsible for organizing school events; such as dances. It also makes clear that they needed funding from the school board"
199,50,The urban planner and the city coordinator developed a new project because he secured community support.,urban planner,he, Urban Planner. This makes sense; as it would be difficult for someone who does not work in that field or does not know much about it; but it would make sense if they were able to secure some kind of funding or resources from outside sources; which could then help them develop their own projects within that area; which might then lead into other areas such as architecture; engineering etc.; so there are many different ways that one can go when looking at how things work together within our society today!
200,51,The consultant and the project manager updated the project timeline because she identified a delay.,project manager,she," consultant.

The reason for this is because it was mentioned that the consultant has been working on identifying delays in the schedule; so it makes sense that he would be updating it based off of his findings. 4) The team members reviewed their progress against their goals at their weekly team meetings so they could identify any issues early. The pronoun is referring to team members. This makes sense as it would make most logical sense if team members were reviewing their progress against goals at weekly team"
201,51,The project manager and the consultant updated the project timeline because she identified a delay.,project manager,she," Consultant.

The reason why it’s “she” instead of “he”; it’s that it would be very unlikely that both; Project Manager AND Consultant; would identify delays in their work; so it would make sense if it was just one person who did it (in this case it seems like it could only be the consultant). 3) A customer service representative called me back after I left her a voicemail about my order. The pronoun refers to"
202,51,The project manager and the consultant updated the project timeline because he identified a delay.,consultant,he," project manager. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that someone else other than him could identify a delay in the project’s schedule.
- 13. A) “The” refers back to “their” which refers back to “them”. Therefore; we know that they are talking about their own team members. B) This answer choice does not make sense as we know from line 25-30 that they were working on their team’s projects together"
203,51,The consultant and the project manager updated the project timeline because he identified a delay.,consultant,he," consultant.

The reason for this is that it’s unlikely that both people would identify a problem at once; so it’s most logical that one person would identify something first (the consultant) then they both update something together (the project timeline). 30. 31. Which of these sentences uses correct punctuation? A. I am going on vacation next week; however; my boss asked me if I could work on Saturday morning so we can finish up some projects"
204,52,The professor and the academic advisor discussed curriculum changes because she received student feedback.,academic advisor,she," Professor. This makes sense; as professors are usually in charge of making decisions about what classes students should take in college or university programs (and therefore would be most knowledgeable on how those classes could change).

### What does it mean when someone says “she”?

When someone uses the word ‘she’; they’re usually talking about another woman or girl who has been mentioned previously in conversation – but not always! Sometimes people will use ‘he’; too (especially if there"
205,52,The academic advisor and the professor discussed curriculum changes because she received student feedback.,academic advisor,she," academic advisor.
- ## What Is A Pronoun In English Grammar?

1260 Words  | 6 Pages

206,52,The academic advisor and the professor discussed curriculum changes because he received student feedback.,professor,he," Professor.

The reason why it’s “he” instead of “she”; it’s that it makes sense that students would give their opinion about classes or teachers; but not that they give opinions on other students or other teachers. This means that if you were asked who gave his opinion first in the sentence above; then your answer should be ‘the teacher’. You can also say ‘the students gave him his first impression.’ However; when we talk about who gave his/her first"
207,52,The professor and the academic advisor discussed curriculum changes because he received student feedback.,professor,he," Professor. This makes sense as professors are usually very involved in making decisions about their classes; so it would be reasonable that they would receive student feedback on what should change within those classes.

## What Is A Pronoun In A Sentence?

A pronoun can replace any noun or name within your sentence without changing its meaning! For example: “I went shopping today.” In this case “I” replaces “me” as both words mean exactly what you"
208,53,The judge and the court reporter overseen the courtroom proceedings because she documented key testimonies.,court reporter,she," Court Reporter. This can be inferred from the fact that it was her job as a court reporter to document all of the testimony in order to create transcripts later on.
- 12. A) NO CHANGE B) in which C) where D) whereby
- This sentence describes how many people are affected by heart disease; which can help explain why it’s so dangerous. Choice A uses which correctly as it’s describing something in relation to heart"
209,53,The court reporter and the judge overseen the courtroom proceedings because she documented key testimonies.,court reporter,she," Court Reporter. This can be inferred from context clues; as it would make sense that it would be her job as a court reporter; not as a judge; to document what was said in the court room.

The teacher gave her students their final exams on Friday so that they could study all weekend long. The teacher gave their students their final exams so that he/she could study all weekend long. Which of these sentences contains a grammatical error? A)"
210,53,The court reporter and the judge overseen the courtroom proceedings because he documented key testimonies.,judge,he," Court Reporter. This makes sense; as it would be unusual if the Judge was documenting any of the testimony in the case.

10) A) 1) B) 2) C) 3) D) 4) E)"
211,53,The judge and the court reporter overseen the courtroom proceedings because he documented key testimonies.,judge,he," Court Reporter.

The reason why it’s referring to the court reporter is that it’s highly unlikely that the Judge would be documenting anything in the court room; but rather; would just document what was said in his own words later on after the trial was completed. A teacher and his students discussed their favorite books at school today. The teacher told them about her favorite book when she was their age. This sentence refers to which of these? A) Teacher B) Students"
212,54,The actor and the dresser rehearsed for the performance because she adjusted the costume details.,dresser,she," actress.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it would be strange if someone else was adjusting her clothes; especially since it says “her” in front of “costume”. 10) A) I’m going on vacation next week; so I won`t see you until next month! B) I`ll see you in two weeks! C) We`re going on holiday tomorrow! D) We won`t see each other"
213,54,The dresser and the actor rehearsed for the performance because she adjusted the costume details.,dresser,she," actress. This is due to her being in charge of adjusting her own costumes; so it makes sense that they would be together during their practice session.

The lawyer and his client discussed their case over lunch at their favorite restaurant on Main Street near City Hall where they both work together as attorneys at different law firms located within walking distance from each other’s offices which are located within walking distance from one another’s homes as well! They were able talk about everything under sun while"
214,54,The dresser and the actor rehearsed for the performance because he adjusted the costume details.,actor,he," Actor. This is because actors are usually in charge of their own costumes; so it makes sense that they would be adjusting them in preparation for a show.

## What Is Pronoun?

A Pronoun is a word used instead of naming someone or something directly. It can be replaced by another word such as “he”; “she” etc.; which makes it easier on your tongue when speaking aloud! Pronouns also help us avoid repe"
215,54,The actor and the dresser rehearsed for the performance because he adjusted the costume details.,actor,he," dresser.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for someone else other than the person who was adjusting the costumes; in other words the dresser; would adjust them again after they were already done being done by him or her in order not only adjust but also make sure everything was perfect so as not cause any problems during performances later on down line when people might notice something wrong about how things look like they should look like but instead looks different from what we"
216,55,The sculptor and the gallery assistant arranged the exhibit because she prepared the artworks.,gallery assistant,she," gallery assistant. This sentence means that it was not only the sculptor who did all of the work; but also that it was in fact; the gallery assistant that helped prepare all of the artwork that would be shown at the exhibition.

## Grammar Quiz 13

The following sentences are all grammatically incorrect in some way or another; please correct them by changing one word in each sentence so that they become grammatically correct sentences. There will only ever be one"
217,55,The gallery assistant and the sculptor arranged the exhibit because she prepared the artworks.,gallery assistant,she," gallery assistant. This makes sense as it would be her job as part of her role as gallery assistant; rather than it being part of his role as a sculptor; which would not necessarily involve preparing his own works; but rather creating them in his studio; etc.

The banker was pleased that he could offer her such generous terms; so he agreed to lend him 10 million dollars at 2% interest per annum over 5 years. This sentence makes no sense"
218,55,The gallery assistant and the sculptor arranged the exhibit because he prepared the artworks.,sculptor,he," sculptor.

The reason for this is that it would be very unlikely that the gallery assistant would prepare any of the artwork; as they are not artists themselves; so it must refer back to the person who did prepare them – the artist/sculptor. 3) A) 1) B 2) C 3) A"
219,55,The sculptor and the gallery assistant arranged the exhibit because he prepared the artworks.,sculptor,he," sculptor. This can be inferred from the fact that it was his job as a sculptor to prepare his own artwork; whereas it would not make sense that it would be someone else’s responsibility as it could lead to miscommunication or mistakes in preparing his artwork; which could cause problems during the exhibition itself if something went wrong due to poor preparation on behalf of someone who wasn't responsible enough (the artist).

### 3) What are some common mistakes people make when"
220,56,The radio host and the producer planned the broadcast because she organized the segment schedule.,producer,she," Producer.

The reason why it refers to producers; not hosts; is that producers are usually responsible for organizing schedules on shows like these. It’s also possible that they both did it together (in which case they would both be correct); but it seems unlikely given what we know about how these types of programs work in general terms (the hosts usually don’t do much)."
221,56,The producer and the radio host planned the broadcast because she organized the segment schedule.,producer,she," producer. This makes sense as producers are usually hired by companies or stations; so they would be responsible for organizing segments on air time slots or schedules; which means that it would make sense if producers were responsible for planning these types of things in general (and not just at one specific point in time).

### What does it mean when someone says you're in my head?

It means you're in my head! It can also refer to someone who has been thinking"
222,56,The producer and the radio host planned the broadcast because he organized the segment schedule.,radio host,he," Producer. This is true since producers are usually in charge of organizing schedules; while hosts only present what they’re told by producers or directors.

The teacher and her assistant prepared their lesson plans together so that it would be easier on them both when teaching class later today! Pronouns refer back either directly or indirectly depending upon context; however if there’s any doubt about which one should go where then just remember these rules: if there’s only two people"
223,56,The radio host and the producer planned the broadcast because he organized the segment schedule.,radio host,he," Producer.

The reason why it refers to producers; as it was his job as a programmer; not as a broadcaster; to organize the program`s agenda. This sentence uses two different words that refer to two different things – “he” refers to Mr Smith; while “them” refers to Mr Smith`s children. This sentence uses two different words that refer to one thing – “he” refers to John Smith (not his father). This example shows how"
224,57,The software architect and the technical writer documented the system architecture because she clarified the design.,technical writer,she," technical writer. The reason for this is because it would be easier for someone who documents systems on a daily basis to understand how they work; therefore; they would probably know what needs to be done in order to document them properly.
- 14. A) Incorrect – This sentence does not make sense; it does not follow proper grammar rules. B) Incorrect – This sentence does not make sense; it does not follow proper grammar rules. C) Correct - This"
225,57,The technical writer and the software architect documented the system architecture because she clarified the design.,technical writer,she," Technical Writer. This makes sense as it would be unlikely that the Software Architect would need to document his own work; as he should already know what his own designs are.
23. 23. 24. Which of these sentences contains a dangling modifier? A) After being fired from her job as a chef at McDonald’s; Jane decided to become a professional chef B) After being fired by Jane; McDonald’s decided not to hire any new chefs"
226,57,The technical writer and the software architect documented the system architecture because he clarified the design.,software architect,he," Technical Writer. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that someone would document something they didn't understand; so it must refer back to the person who did understand it (the technical writer).
- 12) Which of these sentences contains at least one error? A) I am going on vacation next week so I will not attend our weekly team meetings B) My teammate was sick so they could not attend our weekly team meetings C) We are going on holiday next month so"
227,57,The software architect and the technical writer documented the system architecture because he clarified the design.,software architect,he," software architect. This sentence makes sense as it implies that there was only one person who was able to document the information; which would be the software architect as they are most familiar with the information being discussed in the sentence.

## 12) Which of these sentences uses correct parallelism? A) I like playing tennis; I also like playing basketball; I also enjoy running marathons B) My favorite hobbies include reading books; watching movies; listening music C) My brother"
228,58,The economist and the financial reporter discussed the fiscal policy because she interpreted the latest data.,financial reporter,she," economist. This sentence makes sense; as it would be unlikely that someone would interpret their own data; as they are already aware of what their own results are; so therefore; we can assume that the person who has interpreted their results are not them but someone else (the economist).
2018-04-26T13:59:47Z
https://reddit.com/link/8f9bqc"
229,58,The financial reporter and the economist discussed the fiscal policy because she interpreted the latest data.,financial reporter,she," financial reporter. This is so; as it would be unlikely that the economist would interpret any information; as it was not their job; but rather they were there to discuss what was happening in their field of expertise; which in turn; could only come from someone who knew what they were talking about; such as someone in finance; or in other words; someone like the financial reporter.

The banker spoke at length on monetary issues while the investor listened intently. This sentence"
230,58,The financial reporter and the economist discussed the fiscal policy because he interpreted the latest data.,economist,he," Economist. This makes sense as it was most likely that the person who was interpreting the data would be discussing its meaning; not just listening in on what others were saying about its interpretation.

## What are some examples of antecedents?

Antecedents can refer to any noun or noun phrase in English grammar; including proper nouns (names); common nouns (objects); abstract concepts like ideas or feelings; etc.; as well as"
231,58,The economist and the financial reporter discussed the fiscal policy because he interpreted the latest data.,economist,he," Economist. This makes sense as it was the economist who would be interpreting the most recent information on economic trends; not necessarily the journalist; although it could also refer to him as well; but not necessarily him alone; which would make him less specific than the other option; therefore; making his choice less specific in nature.

232,59,The cardiologist and the cardiac technician reviewed the patient reports because she monitored heart rhythms.,cardiac technician,she," cardiac technician. This is because it makes sense that someone who reviews patients' hearts would monitor their heart rhythm as well.

### 30-45 Minutes

234,59,The cardiac technician and the cardiologist reviewed the patient reports because he monitored heart rhythms.,cardiologist,he," Cardiac Technician. This makes sense; as it was stated that “he” (the cardiac technician) would be monitoring heart rhythm; not “she.”
24. 24. Which of these sentences has correct subject-verb agreement? A. A group of people are waiting outside our door. B. Everybody in our class are going on vacation next week. C. One person in my family are going on vacation next month. D. None of us are ready"
235,59,The cardiologist and the cardiac technician reviewed the patient reports because he monitored heart rhythms.,cardiologist,he," cardiac technician.

The reason for this is because it’s most probable that it was him who was monitoring the patients’ heart rates; not the doctor; as it’s not his job; but rather; the doctor’s assistant. 2019-05-13"
236,60,The sports agent and the player liaison negotiated the contract because she analyzed the player‚Äôs performance.,player liaison,she," Sports Agent. This can be inferred from the fact that it was her job as a sports agent to analyze her client’s performance; not that of her client; who would hire someone else if they were concerned about their own performance in games or practice sessions

The story begins in a small town called Gilead where John Ames lives as he writes his last letter"
237,60,The player liaison and the sports agent negotiated the contract because she analyzed the player‚Äôs performance.,player liaison,she," Player Liaison. This is due to the fact that it would be easier for someone who analyzes players' performances to help them in negotiations than it would be for someone who represents players in negotiations.

The head of marketing; the public relations director; and the chief executive officer are responsible for managing all aspects related to marketing campaigns including advertising budget allocation decisions as well publicity events coordination activities such as press conferences or interviews given by celebrities endorsing products sold under their"
238,60,The player liaison and the sports agent negotiated the contract because he analyzed the player‚Äôs performance.,sports agent,he," Sports Agent. This makes sense; as it would be expected that it was the job of the sporting agent; not the players representative; to analyze his or her performances.
- 15) A) I am sure that you will enjoy your stay in our hotel as much as we enjoyed our stay at yours last year. This sentence uses parallelism correctly by using two verbs (enjoy) instead of one verb twice. B) I am sure that you will enjoy staying here in"
239,60,The sports agent and the player liaison negotiated the contract because he analyzed the player‚Äôs performance.,sports agent,he," Sports Agent. This makes sense since it was his job as a sports agent to analyze his client’s performance; not that of his client or anyone else involved in the negotiation process.

The manager was able to convince her boss that they should hire another employee by showing her how much money they would save by doing so; which was why their company needed another person on staff at all times during business hours (to answer phones).

In conclusion; we"
240,61,The entrepreneur and the marketing specialist launched the campaign because she identified a market gap.,marketing specialist,she," marketing specialist.

The reason for this is that it would be very unlikely for both people in question (the entrepreneur or the marketer) would identify something together; as it would not make sense in terms of their roles in business; as they are both different people; so one person (the marketer in question); could identify something (a market gap); which makes much more logical sense than if two different individuals (an entrepreneur or a marketer) were doing so together at once at exactly"
241,61,The marketing specialist and the entrepreneur launched the campaign because she identified a market gap.,marketing specialist,she," Marketing Specialist. This is due to the fact that it was her who discovered the need in the market; so it was her who took action on it.

The businesswoman will meet with the banker in order to discuss financing options. The pronoun refers to: Business Woman. This is due to the fact that he will be discussing financing opportunities with his banker in order to start his own company. A student will meet with their teacher after class so they can review their homework together"
242,61,The marketing specialist and the entrepreneur launched the campaign because he identified a market gap.,entrepreneur,he," Entrepreneur.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual for someone other than the owner of the company or someone in management to identify such gaps in the market; so it would most likely refer to them; not someone else on their team; such as B. Marketing Specialist.

## What are some examples?

Therefore; if you want your audience to understand what your writing means without having to think too much about it (and who doesn’t?"
243,61,The entrepreneur and the marketing specialist launched the campaign because he identified a market gap.,entrepreneur,he," Marketing Specialist. This is due to the fact that it was probably him who was able to identify such gaps in the market; since it would be his area of expertise; not necessarily from other members of his team; such as entrepreneurs or investors.

The investor gave up on investing after receiving negative feedback from her family members about her business idea. Pronoun refers to investor. This can happen due to the investor’s family members being closer than other people involved in"
244,62,The travel agent and the tour guide planned the itinerary because she booked the exclusive tour.,tour guide,she," Travel Agent. This is true since only one of them can be responsible for booking tours; so that person must also plan them.
- 10.A
The correct answer choice is (A). This question requires you to identify which of the sentences contains a grammatical error or errors in subject-verb agreement. In order to answer correctly; read each sentence carefully and identify any errors in subject-verb agreement that may exist. In choice (A); there are two subjects (the"
245,62,The tour guide and the travel agent planned the itinerary because she booked the exclusive tour.,tour guide,she," Travel Agent. This makes sense as only one of them could make such arrangements; so we can assume that they are talking about the same person; so we can assume that “she” refers to “travel agent”.
- 12.C – This question asks you what you think will happen next in the story; so look at each answer choice carefully and think about what makes most logical sense based on your knowledge from reading the story. A) This answer choice does not make logical sense"
246,62,The tour guide and the travel agent planned the itinerary because he booked the exclusive tour.,travel agent,he," Travel Agent. This makes sense as most people would not be able to plan their own trip; so they would need someone else’s help in doing so; such as that of a travel agency or someone who works at one; such as that person mentioned above; which was “he.”
- 12. A) This sentence uses “who” correctly in order to refer back to “the person.” This sentence also uses “whoever” correctly in that it refers back to both “"
247,62,The travel agent and the tour guide planned the itinerary because he booked the exclusive tour.,travel agent,he," travel agent. This is due to the fact that booking tours are usually done by agents; not guides; so we can assume they were talking about him booking tours; rather than her booking them; as would be implied if we assumed “he” was talking about “tour guide”.

The following questions will test your knowledge of how to use Pronouns in English grammar; including possessive adject"
248,63,The coach and the team psychologist developed the training program because she addressed team morale.,team psychologist,she," Team Psychologist. This makes sense as it was her job as a sports psychologist to address any issues that may be affecting the teams performance; such as low morale.
- 10.The manager; who was in charge of all operations; gave instructions on how he wanted things done. This sentence uses which instead of who in order to refer back to manager which makes sense in context since he/she would be in charge of all operations."
249,63,The team psychologist and the coach developed the training program because she addressed team morale.,team psychologist,she," Team Psychologist. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unusual if the trainer were addressing issues of staff motivation; rather than someone who was qualified in psychology or sports psychology.
23. 24. 23) A) I’m not sure if I should go on vacation next week. B) My boss said he would give me time off if there are no problems at work next month. C) My boss said there will"
250,63,The team psychologist and the coach developed the training program because he addressed team morale.,coach,he," Coach.

The reason why it’s “he” instead of “she” or even “they;” as in both; is that it was said earlier on; when they were talking about how they would be addressing their issues as a group rather than individually – so there can only really ever be one person who could address those concerns at once! It might seem like common sense but you never know what kind of questions might come up during your exam! So make sure you always pay attention when"
251,63,The coach and the team psychologist developed the training program because he addressed team morale.,coach,he," Coach. This makes sense since coaches are usually in charge of developing their teams' programs; especially when it comes to improving players' mental health.

The nurse was not able to get through her shift without him asking her out on a date. This sentence refers to someone who has asked out on dates; so it must be someone else that asked out nurses during shifts. This means there were two people involved - one asking while another answered back positively or negatively depending upon how they felt about"
252,64,The firefighter and the fire investigator examined the scene because she looked into the cause of the fire.,fire investigator,she," Fire Investigator.

The reason for this is that it was most likely the job of the fire inspector; not the fireman; to investigate the source of the fire. 3. The student council president gave his speech at 7 p.m.; but he arrived late due to traffic. The pronoun refers to student council president. This is true because it would be unlikely that someone other than the student council would give such a speech in front of everyone else in school. "
253,64,The fire investigator and the firefighter examined the scene because she looked into the cause of the fire.,fire investigator,she," Fire Investigator. This makes sense as it would be unusual if the firefighter was looking at what caused the fire; as they are usually there to put out fires; not investigate them.

The nurse was asked about her job by her friend; who wanted to know what made her want to become one in the first place. She replied that there were many reasons why but one stood out above all others – helping people in need! Her friend then asked whether or not nurses get paid"
254,64,The fire investigator and the firefighter examined the scene because he looked into the cause of the fire.,firefighter,he," Fire Investigator. This is due to the fact that it was stated in the passage; “The two men were at odds over who should be responsible.” This implies they are not on good terms; therefore it would make sense if they did not talk about who caused it together.
23. 23. A) It can be determined from the passage that it has been 10 years since their last visit together; therefore it can also be determined that their friendship has lasted 1"
255,64,The firefighter and the fire investigator examined the scene because he looked into the cause of the fire.,firefighter,he," Fire Investigator. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely that the firefighter would look into the cause of the fire; as it was his job to put out fires; not investigate them.

The police officer was talking on his radio when they arrived at the crime scene. The police officer used her radio while they were driving there so they could get there as quickly as possible. This makes most logical sense in terms of what happened"
256,65,The paramedic and the dispatcher coordinated the rescue because she received an urgent call.,dispatcher,she," dispatcher. This makes sense as it was her job as a dispatcher to receive calls; so we can assume that if someone called in; they would contact her first; then coordinate from there on out.
- 21/30"
257,65,The dispatcher and the paramedic coordinated the rescue because she received an urgent call.,dispatcher,she," Dispatcher.

The reason why it refers to the dispatcher instead of the paramedic is that it was most likely the person who took the emergency calls; so they would be most likely to receive such calls; so therefore; we can conclude that the answer would be “dispatcher”."
258,65,The dispatcher and the paramedic coordinated the rescue because he received an urgent call.,paramedic,he," Paramedics Coordinator.

The reason why it`s him; not her or them; is that we know from context clues (the words “dispatch” and “coordinate”) that it`s probably someone who works at 911 or at least someone in charge of emergency services. Since it can be either male or female (and since we don`t know if there are multiple people involved); you should use him/her instead of him/her (or them"
259,65,The paramedic and the dispatcher coordinated the rescue because he received an urgent call.,paramedic,he," paramedic. This makes sense since it would be easier if one person called another person than if two people called each other at once; so it makes sense that they would coordinate their efforts in order not only save lives but also avoid confusion among themselves or others involved (such as police officers).

This is due to the fact that it would be easier for someone who has been trained in statistical analysis; such as a biostatistician; rather than someone who hasn’t (scientist).

The nurse was responsible for administering medication while the doctor supervised her work; however both were present during each session so they could answer any questions patients might ask about their treatment plan or side effects from medications taken previously without having them wait until next time"
263,66,The scientist and the biostatistician analyzed the study data because he computed the statistics.,scientist,he," biostatistician. This makes sense; as it was mentioned that only one person in the group could compute the statistics; therefore it must be him that did it.
31. A) It's true that it's difficult to get good help these days; however; I think it would still be better than doing everything yourself. B) It may not seem like much of a difference now; however; I can assure you that once we get started on our project things will"
264,67,The civil engineer and the surveyor assessed the construction site because she measured the land.,surveyor,she," surveyor.
- ## What Is A Good Example Of An Allusion?

The best example of allusion in literature would be when Shakespeare uses allusions from Greek mythology; Roman history or Biblical stories as part his plays or sonnets such as Romeo & Juliet (1597) where he references many different sources including Homer’s Iliad (8th century BC); Virgil’s Aeneid (29-19 B"
265,67,The surveyor and the civil engineer assessed the construction site because she measured the land.,surveyor,she," surveyor.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for the civil engineer to measure the land; as they are not usually involved in measuring things; whereas it would make sense if it was the surveyor who did it; as they are usually involved in measuring things such as buildings or pieces of land. 12) My friend has been working on her car all day but I don’t think he will finish by tonight. 3) My friend has been working on"
266,67,The surveyor and the civil engineer assessed the construction site because he measured the land.,civil engineer,he," Surveyor. This makes sense; as it would be easier if one person did all of the measuring rather than two people doing half each.

## How do you use who or whom in a sentence?

Who or whom are used in sentences as interrogative words (words that ask questions). Who can also function as a relative word (a word used to connect two clauses) when used at the beginning of relative clauses (clauses beginning with who) . Who can also function"
267,67,The civil engineer and the surveyor assessed the construction site because he measured the land.,civil engineer,he," surveyor.

The reason for this is that it was mentioned earlier in the text that it would be better if one of them could measure it; so we can assume that one person did measure it; which means that one person did measure it which means they must be talking about him/her when they say “he”. This also makes sense as you wouldn’t want two people measuring something at once as there could potentially be errors made by both parties involved which could lead them into trouble later"
268,68,The veterinarian and the animal caretaker reviewed the treatment plan because she monitored the recovery.,animal caretaker,she," vet. This is due to the fact that vets are most often responsible for monitoring patient recoveries in hospitals or clinics; as well as reviewing their own plans of action during these times of need!

269,68,The animal caretaker and the veterinarian reviewed the treatment plan because she monitored the recovery.,animal caretaker,she," Animal Caregiver. This makes sense; as it would be expected that he would monitor his progress; not the vet; as he was not present during the operation or aftercare; but only when needed by the client or vet.

## 2018-19 FAFSA Changes You Should Know About

### Posted on October 3rd; 2017 in Uncategorized | No Comments »

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid"
270,68,The animal caretaker and the veterinarian reviewed the treatment plan because he monitored the recovery.,veterinarian,he," vet. This makes sense; as it was mentioned that they were reviewing the treatment plan together which means that they both must be involved in monitoring the patient’s progress.
25. 25. 10. A student who was studying at home fell asleep while reading his book on economics. He dreamed of being on vacation on a tropical island where there are beautiful white sandy beaches and palm trees swaying gently in the breeze. When he woke up from his dream"
271,68,The veterinarian and the animal caretaker reviewed the treatment plan because he monitored the recovery.,veterinarian,he," Veterinary technician. This makes sense; as it was probably his job to monitor his progress in his rehabilitation process.
- 10.CThe answer choice that best completes the sentence without changing its meaning or leaving out any necessary information would be choice (C). This choice correctly uses “their” as it refers back to “people.” Choice (A) uses “its;” which would not make sense as it refers back to people. Choice (B) uses “"
272,69,The radio journalist and the sound editor reported live because she adjusted the audio levels.,sound editor,she," Sound Editor. This makes sense as it would be her job to adjust the audio levels of the broadcast; not that of the Radio Journalist.
- 10)The head of HR; who was also responsible for security; fired him after he failed his background check. This sentence has two clauses joined by who. Who refers back to head of HR as that person would be responsible for security as well as being head of human resources."
273,69,The sound editor and the radio journalist reported live because she adjusted the audio levels.,sound editor,she," Sound Editor. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely that the reporter would adjust the volume of their own microphone during their own broadcast.

### 2019/20 Paper 3 Question 4 (a) - June 2019 QP (Northern Ireland only) (specimen paper) (specimen paper) (Northern Ireland only) - Mark Scheme

The following questions"
274,69,The sound editor and the radio journalist reported live because he adjusted the audio levels.,radio journalist,he," sound editor. This is due to the fact that it would be easier for him; as opposed to her; to adjust the audio level of his own microphone while reporting live on air.
- 14/08/2019 08:35 AM
- Answer this Question"
275,69,The radio journalist and the sound editor reported live because he adjusted the audio levels.,radio journalist,he," sound engineer. This makes sense; as it was his job to adjust the audio level during their report on air.
- 12/20/2021 in English (US)"
276,70,The director and the set designer planned the stage layout because she envisioned a creative setup.,set designer,she," Director; Set Designer.

The reason why it’s these two people that are referred to as “she” in the sentence above is that they both work together on creating something new – which would be their job description if you were looking at them from afar without knowing what exactly each person does within their respective roles within your company or organization (which may vary depending on where you live). So it makes sense then when we say ‘she’; we mean both of them collectively rather"
277,70,The set designer and the director planned the stage layout because she envisioned a creative setup.,set designer,she," Set Designer. This makes sense since it would be difficult for the Director to visualize something that does not exist yet; but easier for someone who has experience in designing sets; such as a Set Designer; to do so.
24. 25. 16) A) NO CHANGE B) he C) they D) we NO CHANGE B) they C) we D) he NO CHANGE B) they C) he D) they"
278,70,The set designer and the director planned the stage layout because he envisioned a creative setup.,director,he," director. This makes sense; as directors are usually in charge of planning out how things will look on screen or onstage in plays or musicals.

## 10) What do you think?

What do you think? Do these questions make any difference in your life or business today? If so; please share them below! And if not… well then maybe it’s time we got together again soon so that I can help answer some other questions that might be bothering"
279,70,The director and the set designer planned the stage layout because he envisioned a creative setup.,director,he," set designer. This is true; as it was stated that “he” (the set designer) would be responsible for creating the “creative setup.”

## Question 20 (1 of 2 Based on Passage)

The correct answer choice is (C). According to the passage; “The first step in making sure that your company’s data are secure involves understanding what data you need to protect.” This means that it’s necessary to understand what information needs protection"
280,71,The choreographer and the dance instructor designed the routine because she selected the music.,dance instructor,she," Choreographer. This makes sense since it was her job as a choreographer to select the music that would be used in their performance.
- 12.B
The answer here should not come as much of a surprise; given what we know about how people use their phones today; but still; let’s break down why answer choice B makes so much sense here. We are told that people use smartphones while driving even though they shouldn't do so while driving."
281,71,The dance instructor and the choreographer designed the routine because she selected the music.,dance instructor,she," dancer/dance instructor/choreographer. This answer choice can be eliminated; as it does not make sense that the person who selects the music would design the routine.
32. D – This question requires you to identify which of the following statements would best fit into the blank space in order to create a logical sentence that makes grammatical sense; as well as fits into context within the paragraph. In order to answer this question; you must first identify what type of word"
282,71,The dance instructor and the choreographer designed the routine because he selected the music.,choreographer,he," Choreographer. This makes sense; as it would be unlikely that someone would select music if they were not going to design it as well.

The dancer was surprised when her partner did not show up at rehearsal; it turned out that his car broke down on his way there! This sentence has no ambiguity in it; therefore we can say that there are no ambiguities present within these events either (since there’s only one possible interpretation). However… there may"
283,71,The choreographer and the dance instructor designed the routine because he selected the music.,choreographer,he," choreographer. This can be inferred by looking at who would select the music; which would most likely be the person who created or chose it; which in turn refers back to the choreographer.

The following are examples of sentences that contain indefinite or ambiguous antecedents (these sentences do not contain any antecedent): I think it's time we all went home now. I think we should all go home now. It was very cold outside"
284,72,The real estate developer and the property consultant evaluated the project because she analyzed market trends.,property consultant,she," property consultant.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely for both of them to analyze market trends; so it would most likely refer to one of those two people in particular. A financial analyst and her colleague reviewed their investment strategy because they were concerned about recent losses in their portfolio. Pronoun refers to financial analysts or colleagues? Pronoun refers to financial analyst or colleague? Financial analyst or colleague are both correct answers here as it could refer to either one"
285,72,The property consultant and the real estate developer evaluated the project because she analyzed market trends.,property consultant,she," property consultant.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of what they are doing in their jobs; which makes it easier to understand why they would be analyzing something together rather than just evaluating something together as two separate people would do if their jobs were different from each other’s jobs (like if one person was doing accounting work while another person did marketing work). It’s also possible that both people could analyze things separately but still come up with similar results at times"
286,72,The property consultant and the real estate developer evaluated the project because he analyzed market trends.,real estate developer,he," property consultant.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if the real estate developer was analyzing market trends; as it would not make sense if they were evaluating projects as well as analyzing market trends at the same time; so it must refer back to the person who did evaluate projects; which are the consultants; so it must refer back to them; which means that “he” refers to “property consultants”."
287,72,The real estate developer and the property consultant evaluated the project because he analyzed market trends.,real estate developer,he," Real Estate Developer.

The reason why it refers to it; since it was mentioned that they were analyzing marketing trends; which are related to business; which in turn refers to the real estate agent who was mentioned first in the sentence. A personal or relative pronoun replaces or represents another noun or noun group called antecedent. A relative clause begins with relative pronouns such as who or that (or who) that refer to someone who has already been mentioned ("
288,73,The financial analyst and the client relations specialist reviewed the portfolio because she noticed unusual activity.,client relations specialist,she," financial analyst.
- 2016-17 FAFSA Changes (5 minutes) | Video | 5 minutes; 3 seconds
- How To Fill Out FAFSA (4 minutes) | Video | 4 minutes; 9 seconds"
289,73,The client relations specialist and the financial analyst reviewed the portfolio because she noticed unusual activity.,client relations specialist,she," Financial Analyst.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for someone who works in finance; such as a financial analyst; to notice any abnormalities within their portfolios than someone who does not work there or has no experience working there (such as clients). This means they are most likely going over all of these things together so they can find out what happened when something went wrong!"
290,73,The client relations specialist and the financial analyst reviewed the portfolio because he noticed unusual activity.,financial analyst,he," Financial Analyst. This makes sense; as it would be his job as a financial analyst to notice any unusual activities in his company’s portfolios; not that of the Client Relations Specialist; who works in sales; not finance.

13) A) Incorrect – This sentence contains no errors B) Incorrect – This sentence contains no errors C) Incorrect – This sentence contains no errors D) Incorrect – This sentence contains no errors E) Correct –"
291,73,The financial analyst and the client relations specialist reviewed the portfolio because he noticed unusual activity.,financial analyst,he," Financial Analyst.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that the customer relationship manager would notice any kind of anomaly in his work; so it’s probably not him who saw something strange going on. It was her job as a manager at one point or another during her career as well!"
292,74,The market researcher and the brand strategist studied consumer behavior because she gathered new insights.,brand strategist,she," market researcher.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in context; as it was her job to gather information about consumers; so it makes sense that she would be able to gather new insight into their behaviors; whereas the other two people in the sentence are unlikely to be gathering such data. 10. She asked her friend if he could help him study accounting principles. She asked him about his friend's accounting principles. He asked them about their accounting principles. They asked"
293,74,The brand strategist and the market researcher studied consumer behavior because she gathered new insights.,brand strategist,she," Brand Strategist.

The reason why it refers to “brand strategists” rather than “market researchers;” as it could be argued; is that it was probably easier; or at least less expensive; for one person rather than two people from different departments in two companies to gather these insights. It would also make sense if they were working together on something else at their company’s headquarters in New York City (or wherever). This makes sense given how much time they spent together during their trip"
294,74,The brand strategist and the market researcher studied consumer behavior because he gathered new insights.,market researcher,he," market researcher. This makes sense; as it was his job as a market researcher to gather information about consumers' behaviors.

The social media manager was in charge of creating content that was relevant to her audience's interests. She used data from her analytics dashboard as well as feedback from customers on social channels like Facebook or Twitter when crafting posts so they would be engaging enough without being too salesy! The social media manager created engaging posts by using data from analytics dashboards along"
295,74,The market researcher and the brand strategist studied consumer behavior because he gathered new insights.,market researcher,he," market researcher. This sentence makes sense as it would be easier for one person; rather than two people; to gather information on consumers' behaviors.
24. **C** This question requires you to identify which of the sentences has no errors in its use of punctuation or capitalization. Choice (A) has no errors in its use of punctuation or capitalization; therefore; (A) is correct. Choice (B) has one error in its use of punctuation--the"
296,75,The policy advisor and the legislative assistant drafted the proposal because she summarized public opinion.,legislative assistant,she," legislative assistant.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for someone who has access to information about what people think in order to create something like legislation or proposals based off of it than it would if they were just guessing at what people wanted without any data behind them; therefore; we can assume that whoever wrote down these words knew exactly how much research went into making sure everything was accurate so as not leave anything out when presenting their findings later on down line during meetings where decisions"
297,75,The legislative assistant and the policy advisor drafted the proposal because she summarized public opinion.,legislative assistant,she," Legislative Assistant. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it was mentioned in the sentence prior.

299,75,The policy advisor and the legislative assistant drafted the proposal because he summarized public opinion.,policy advisor,he," Legislative Assistant.
- 10.The correct answer choice is (D). In order to answer this question; you must first identify what “it” refers back to in order to determine what “it” means in context of the sentence. In order to do so; we must look at what comes after it – that it was not as easy as it seemed – which means that “it” refers back to the word easy. Therefore; we can eliminate answer choices (A) and"
300,76,The civil servant and the public relations officer organized the community event because she coordinated local support.,public relations officer,she," public relations officer.

The reason for this is that it was her job as a PR person; so it makes sense that they would coordinate their efforts; rather than someone else doing so on her behalf. 10) A doctor; nurse or physiotherapist can help you recover from surgery or injury by providing advice on how best to recover at home after leaving hospital care facilities such as hospitals where they work full-time jobs during weekdays but also offer part-time services during"
301,76,The public relations officer and the civil servant organized the community event because she coordinated local support.,public relations officer,she," Public Relations Officer. This is due to the fact that it was most probably her job as PR manager to coordinate local support; therefore; it would be her who would coordinate these activities.
30 of 30"
302,76,The public relations officer and the civil servant organized the community event because he coordinated local support.,civil servant,he," Public Relations Officer. This is due to the fact that it would be easier for him as opposed to her; as it would take longer if they were both involved in organizing the event; which could cause confusion between them both; as they may not know who was doing what; so therefore one person should do all of the organising of the event so there are no problems or issues between both of them during organising of the event.
2017-08-23"
303,76,The civil servant and the public relations officer organized the community event because he coordinated local support.,civil servant,he," Public Relations Officer. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in terms of context; as it would be his job to coordinate such events.
- 10) A) A new study has found that children who are given time-outs by their parents may become aggressive in later life. This sentence suggests that time-outs can lead children to become aggressive in later years. B) Children who receive time-out from their parents may not learn how to control themselves when they get"
304,77,The historian and the curator prepared the exhibition because she researched historical artifacts.,curator,she," Historian. This is due to the fact that historians are known to research history; while curators prepare exhibitions.

The doctor gave his patient some medicine after he examined her. This sentence has two possible answers; doctor or patient. This sentence has two possible answers; doctor or patient. This sentence can be interpreted in different ways depending on how you read it. If we read from left to right then we would say “the doctor gave his patient some medicine after examining him.”"
305,77,The curator and the historian prepared the exhibition because she researched historical artifacts.,curator,she," Historian. This is due to the fact that historians are usually responsible for researching historical facts; while curators may be responsible for organizing exhibitions but not necessarily researching them.

## What does it mean when someone says “I’m sorry”?

When someone apologizes or expresses regret about something they did wrong in your relationship (or even just in general); there’s usually some kind of underlying meaning behind their words—and sometimes those hidden messages can"
306,77,The curator and the historian prepared the exhibition because he researched historical artifacts.,historian,he," Historian.

The reason why it refers to history rather than curatorship; as it has been said that historians are doing research on historical objects; while it has not yet been said that it has done research in its own field; which would be related to museums or exhibitions. 3) In 2014; 57% of students were admitted directly after graduation from high school; 37%; after two years; And only 6%;"
307,77,The historian and the curator prepared the exhibition because he researched historical artifacts.,historian,he," Historian.

The reason why it refers to historians rather than curators; as they are both involved in preparing exhibitions; but historians are responsible for researching historical artefacts while curators organize them into collections or displays."
308,78,The statistician and the data scientist analyzed the survey because she discovered significant correlations.,data scientist,she," statisticians.

The reason for this is that it was not specified in any way whether it should be singular or plural; so it should default back to singular as there are no other indicators of whether there were multiple people involved. 2) I'm going to give you 30 seconds each to tell me what your role at work entails. You can start when I say go! I'll start counting now! 1….."
309,78,The data scientist and the statistician analyzed the survey because she discovered significant correlations.,data scientist,she," data scientist. This makes sense; as it would be unusual that both of them would discover something at once or at least not in such a way that it would need mentioning here.

312,79,The security guard and the front desk attendant monitored the premises because she noticed suspicious activity.,front desk attendant,she," Front Desk Attendant. This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely for someone who works as a security guard to notice something unusual; as it would be their job; but not as much so for those working at reception desks; as they are not trained in such matters; so their noticing something unusual makes sense here .

The doctor was able to diagnose her patient’s condition quickly due to his extensive knowledge of medicine . In this sentence; we can see how"
313,79,The front desk attendant and the security guard monitored the premises because she noticed suspicious activity.,front desk attendant,she," Front Desk Attendant. This is true; since it was her who first saw something strange happening in her workplace.

314,79,The front desk attendant and the security guard monitored the premises because he noticed suspicious activity.,security guard,he," Security Guard.

318,80,The wildlife coordinator and the environmental scientist studied the habitat because he observed animal patterns.,environmental scientist,he," Environmental Scientist.

320,81,The fashion designer and the style consultant developed the collection because she curated the fabric samples.,style consultant,she," Fashion Designer.

The reason why it refers to the fashion designer is that it’s very unlikely that someone would be able to develop something without having any input from them; so they must’ve been involved in some way or another!"
321,81,The style consultant and the fashion designer developed the collection because she curated the fabric samples.,style consultant,she," Style Consultant. This is because it makes sense that someone who works in styling would be responsible for choosing fabrics; rather than someone working as a designer; as they would be responsible for creating designs from fabrics; rather than choosing them.

The photographer was chosen by her agent as he has worked on many successful campaigns. This sentence has no errors; therefore it does not need any changes made to it."
322,81,The style consultant and the fashion designer developed the collection because he curated the fabric samples.,fashion designer,he," fashion designer. This can be inferred from the fact that it was his job as a fashion designer to work on collections; while it would not make sense that it would be his responsibility as a stylist to do so.

323,81,The fashion designer and the style consultant developed the collection because he curated the fabric samples.,fashion designer,he," Fashion Designer.

The reason for this is that it's unlikely that both of them would share innovative strategies; but it's possible that one would share them; so it must be her who shares them; not him. 3) The marketing director and the brand manager created new ads because they wanted to increase sales. The pronoun refers to both marketing director and brand manager as both are responsible for creating new ads. 4) The project lead and her team worked on the"
329,83,The startup mentor and the tech entrepreneur hosted the workshop because she shared innovative strategies.,startup mentor,she," Startup Mentor. This is due to her being able to share her knowledge on how startups can be successful in their industry; which makes it easier for them when they host workshops together later on down the line!

## What are some examples of subject-verb agreement?

Subject-verb agreement means that you need to make sure your subject matches up correctly in number (singular or plural) as well as person (first; second or third). For example; if I"
330,83,The startup mentor and the tech entrepreneur hosted the workshop because he shared innovative strategies.,tech entrepreneur,he," tech entrepreneur. This makes sense since it was stated that he was sharing his own personal experience of being in business; so it would make sense if he were sharing some sort of strategy or tactic used by him personally during business operations which could be considered “innovative”.

## How do you use who/whom/whose/whose?

The word “who” refers to people while “whose” refers to things (like animals). You can use either one"
331,83,The tech entrepreneur and the startup mentor hosted the workshop because he shared innovative strategies.,tech entrepreneur,he," tech entrepreneur.

The reason for this is because it’s most common that entrepreneurs share new ideas; not mentors. 2018 was when they launched their first product in beta mode in 3 cities in India. The pronoun refers to: they. This refers back to both entrepreneurs who launched in beta mode in three cities in India. They are both entrepreneurs who launched together so they are both referred back to by “they”. They are launching new products"
332,84,The venture capitalist and the business analyst reviewed the investment proposal because she projected high returns.,business analyst,she," business analyst. This is due to the fact that it would be highly unlikely that someone would project their own return on their own investments; as it may seem biased; so therefore we can assume they are talking about someone else's return projection.
13. **A** In order to determine which word should replace ""them"" in order to make sense of the sentence we must first look at what each word means individually. A niche market refers to something very specific or particular;"
333,84,The business analyst and the venture capitalist reviewed the investment proposal because she projected high returns.,business analyst,she," business analyst. This sentence implies that it was the business analyst who made projections of high return; so it would be logical if they were reviewing their own work; as opposed to someone else’s work; which makes them most likely to review their own projection of return on investments.

##### Question 24

The correct answer is (A). This sentence contains two independent clauses joined by “and.” This means there must be either a comma or semicolon"
334,84,The business analyst and the venture capitalist reviewed the investment proposal because he projected high returns.,venture capitalist,he," business analyst or venture capitalist? This question can be answered by looking at who would most likely project higher returns; which would most likely be the business analyst; since they are in charge of analyzing businesses; which would include projecting their future performance.

## What Is Pronouns In Grammar?

Pronouns in grammar refer to words that replace nouns or noun phrases within sentences or clauses. Pronouns can take many forms such"
335,84,The venture capitalist and the business analyst reviewed the investment proposal because he projected high returns.,venture capitalist,he," Venture Capitalist.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of logic; as it would be highly unlikely that the Business Analyst was reviewing the Investment Proposal by himself/herself. Also it makes logical sense as it was mentioned earlier in the sentence about him/her projecting higher returns. This means they are talking about him/her as opposed to her as they were talking earlier on in the sentence. A manager gave his assistant instructions on how"
336,85,The film editor and the production assistant cut the footage because she refined the scene transitions.,production assistant,she," Production Assistant.

The reason why it refers to her instead of him; which would be the logical choice; since it’s about cutting; which would fall under his job description; but we know that he’s not doing his job; so we can assume that they are talking about her; who has been doing his work as well; which means they must mean her; not him. 2) What do you think? What do I mean by “what” here? What does"
337,85,The production assistant and the film editor cut the footage because she refined the scene transitions.,production assistant,she," Film Editor. This is due to her being able to make better decisions on how scenes transition; which would make her most qualified in cutting the scenes in question.
- 12.The following sentences are all grammatically correct; except one of them has been altered slightly so that it no longer makes sense in English. Which sentence does not make logical sense? A) It was my mother who told me about your mother’s passing away last week; B) My father said he would"
338,85,The production assistant and the film editor cut the footage because he refined the scene transitions.,film editor,he," Film Editor.

The reason for this is that it makes sense in terms of context; as it would be easier for him; as opposed to her; to do so. 10) A) 2) B) 3) C) D) E) F) G) H) I) J) K) L) M) N) O) P) Q) R) S) T) U) V) W) X) Y) Z) Aa"
339,85,The film editor and the production assistant cut the footage because he refined the scene transitions.,film editor,he," Film Editor.

The reason why it’s not Production Assistant; is that it would be very unlikely; as they are usually responsible for other tasks; such as organizing equipment or arranging schedules. A photographer took pictures of her family at their home in London on Sunday morning when they were all together again after being apart so long due to work commitments abroad which made them miss each other terribly but now everything has changed thanks largely due what happened last weekend!"
340,86,The curator and the museum guide prepared the tour because she arranged the artifacts.,museum guide,she," Curator.

The reason why it refers to it; since it was mentioned in the first sentence that he organized all of his works; so he would be able to arrange them as well; as he would know where they are located; which makes him better suited than anyone else on that list. This article has been written by GSA Content Generator Demoversion!"
341,86,The museum guide and the curator prepared the tour because she arranged the artifacts.,museum guide,she," Museum Guide. This makes sense since it would be easier if one person did all of these tasks rather than two people doing them separately!

## What are some examples?

There are many examples where you can use “she” instead of “her”. For example; if someone says that they’re going on vacation next week but doesn’t specify who will go along then it would make sense if we said something like She went on her trip last year so maybe it was her again"
342,86,The museum guide and the curator prepared the tour because he arranged the artifacts.,curator,he," Curator.

The reason why it refers to it; since it was mentioned in the previous sentence; that they were preparing the exhibition together; therefore; we can assume that they are talking about him since there would be no point in mentioning him if there wasn’t something special or different from her. 3) Which of these sentences contains a misplaced modifier? A) I saw my friend at school who plays soccer on Saturday mornings. B) I saw my"

344,87,The supply chain manager and the logistics coordinator reviewed the shipment schedule because she identified a delay.,logistics coordinator,she," supply chain manager. This makes sense; as it was her job to identify any delays in shipping schedules.
- 10.The project leader spoke at length about her vision of what could be accomplished by the team during their time together at the conference. Which of these sentences best describes what happened? She spoke at great length about her vision of what could be achieved by the team while they were all attending the conference. She spoke at great length about how much they would accomplish while they"
345,87,The logistics coordinator and the supply chain manager reviewed the shipment schedule because she identified a delay.,logistics coordinator,she," logistics coordinator.

The reason for this is that it was mentioned earlier in the sentence; so it makes sense that they would be reviewing the schedule together as they are both involved in planning things out together as well!

### What do you mean by “pronoun”?

A pronoun refers back or forward within its own sentence or paragraph (or even across sentences). It can also refer back across multiple sentences if they’re all related somehow (like when"
346,87,The logistics coordinator and the supply chain manager reviewed the shipment schedule because he identified a delay.,supply chain manager,he," Supply Chain Manager.

The reason for this is that it would be unusual if someone other than the person who discovered it was delayed; would review it. A) B) C) D) 32. A new employee in human resources has been assigned as liaison between her department and marketing. She will meet regularly with her counterpart in marketing to discuss issues of mutual concern. Her counterpart would most likely work as which of these? A) Sales representative B) Account"
347,87,The supply chain manager and the logistics coordinator reviewed the shipment schedule because he identified a delay.,supply chain manager,he," logistics coordinator.

The reason for this is that it was his job as a logistics coordinator to identify delays in shipping schedules; so it makes sense that it would be him who did so. 2) Which of these sentences contains a grammatical error? A) She said it wasn't her fault; B) She told me I should ask him; C) He told me I should ask him; D) They were supposed to arrive at 1"
348,88,The business consultant and the assistant director strategized the merger because she coordinated the negotiations.,assistant director,she," assistant director. This makes sense since it would be most logical that someone would coordinate any type of negotiation; especially in terms of business; rather than someone who just consults businesses on how they can improve their strategies or other aspects that are not related to negotiating or making deals.

The lawyer was able to convince his client that he should settle out of court due in part by his ability as well as his knowledge about how much money could potentially go towards legal fees if they went through"
349,88,The assistant director and the business consultant strategized the merger because she coordinated the negotiations.,assistant director,she," Assistant Director. This is so; as it makes sense that someone who coordinates would be in charge of negotiating as well; which would mean that they are both part of one person; which means they must refer back to one person; which must refer back to one gender; therefore it must refer back to female as there were only two people mentioned as being female while there were three males mentioned as being male.

## 10) Which word does not belong? A) A B)"
350,88,The assistant director and the business consultant strategized the merger because he coordinated the negotiations.,business consultant,he," Business Consultant.

The reason why it refers to him rather than her; since it was not specified that there were only two people in that room; but that there were many; so you can assume that both men and women are present; so you cannot assume which one of them did what; unless specified; which means; if they do not specify; then they will be considered as men by default. 3) A man who has been working at his job since 197"
351,88,The business consultant and the assistant director strategized the merger because he coordinated the negotiations.,business consultant,he," business consultant. This makes sense; as it would be most logical that the person who would coordinate would also coordinate the negotiation of the deal as well.

The CEOs from both companies agreed on terms after they negotiated them together. This sentence has no relative clause or relative pronouns in it at all! It's just two independent clauses joined by ""after."" In fact; you could even say ""They negotiated terms together"" or ""They agreed on terms together"
352,89,The HR director and the talent acquisition specialist organized the recruitment drive because she planned candidate interviews.,talent acquisition specialist,she," Talent Acquisition Specialist. This is due to the fact that it's her job as part of her role; so it's most likely that they would be planning them together rather than someone else doing so on her behalf.
10. 10. 10) A) It was her idea to organize a team building day in order to improve team morale B) It was his idea to organize a team building day in order to improve team morale C"
353,89,The talent acquisition specialist and the HR director organized the recruitment drive because she planned candidate interviews.,talent acquisition specialist,she," Talent Acquisition Specialist.

The reason for this is that it was probably her job as a talent acquisition specialist to plan job interviews; so it makes sense in context. 10) A) 5 B) 4 C) 3 D) 2 E) 6 F) 7 G) 8 H) 9 I) 1 J) 10 K) 11 L) 12 M) 13 N)"
354,89,The talent acquisition specialist and the HR director organized the recruitment drive because he planned candidate interviews.,HR director,he," Talent Acquisition Specialist.

The reason why it’s him; rather than her; as it could be either gender in that position; but it says “he” in front of “planned” so we know that “he” refers back to him as well. 4) The lawyer was in charge of preparing all legal documents at the company because they were required by law to do so every year on time or face penalties from regulators if they failed within "
355,89,The HR director and the talent acquisition specialist organized the recruitment drive because he planned candidate interviews.,HR director,he," Talent Acquisition Specialist.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that both people would plan candidates’ meetings; but it’s possible; so it could also refer to both of them; which makes both answers correct; although I think answer A has been given as correct in most cases; so I think you should choose answer A if you are unsure about which answer to choose in case both answers are not available in your test."
356,90,The cybersecurity analyst and the incident responder investigated the breach because she traced the security logs.,incident responder,she," cybersecurity analyst. This makes sense as it was her job as part of her role in her company; which means that they are both responsible for investigating any potential threats or vulnerabilities within their organization’s network infrastructure

## What Are Pronoun Examples?

Pronoun examples include “I;” “you;” “he/she” or any other word used instead of naming someone specifically (e.g.; my friend). Pronoun examples include I; you;"
357,90,The incident responder and the cybersecurity analyst investigated the breach because she traced the security logs.,incident responder,she," incident responder.

The reason for this is that it was mentioned in the sentence that it was her who traced the security logs; therefore; making her responsible for investigating the breach along with the cybersecurity analyst."
358,90,The incident responder and the cybersecurity analyst investigated the breach because he traced the security logs.,cybersecurity analyst,he," Cyber Security Analyst. This is due to the fact that it was his responsibility as part of his job description; which included monitoring; detecting; investigating; analyzing; responding to incidents involving information systems in order not only protect them but also make sure they are working properly so there will be no problems later on down line when someone else needs access or uses them without permission (i).

## What does it mean when someone says “I’m not sure”?

"
359,90,The cybersecurity analyst and the incident responder investigated the breach because he traced the security logs.,cybersecurity analyst,he," Cyber Security Analyst.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for one person (cybersecurity analyst) than two people (cybersecurity analysts; Incident Responders). In addition; it would make sense if they were working together on something like investigating or tracing something rather than just talking about what happened in general terms without any specific details given by either party involved in conversation which could lead us into thinking they are both equally responsible when really only one of"
360,91,The digital marketer and the social media coordinator launched the campaign because she tracked online engagement.,social media coordinator,she," Social Media Coordinator.
- 10.A)The correct answer choice is A; “them.” This sentence uses “them” as a gender-neutral singular third-person pronoun; which means it refers back to “anyone who wants to join our team;” not “our company;” since it’s singular (not plural). It’s also not correct grammatically since you can only use singular they when you don’t know whether someone identifies"
361,91,The social media coordinator and the digital marketer launched the campaign because she tracked online engagement.,social media coordinator,she," social media coordinator. This makes sense; as it would be her job to launch campaigns; not his job as he’s in charge of marketing; not campaigns.
- Question 41 – Correct answer B) (The) company’s (accounting) department has been working on (their) budget (for months). This sentence has no errors in grammar or spelling so we can eliminate answers A); C); D). Answer B); however; has two errors"
362,91,The social media coordinator and the digital marketer launched the campaign because he tracked online engagement.,digital marketer,he," Digital Marketer. This makes sense as it was his job to launch campaigns; so they would be working together on that task; but his job would also include tracking that information; so that would make him most likely responsible for tracking the information as well.
21. ## 21. Which of these sentences contains at least one error? (1 point) A. I was in New York City last week; where I saw my favorite band play at Madison Square Garden. B. My"
363,91,The digital marketer and the social media coordinator launched the campaign because he tracked online engagement.,digital marketer,he," digital marketing manager.

The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that the social media manager would launch the campaign without input from his boss; which means it must refer back to him instead of her. It’s not always easy knowing when you should use “he” or “she;” but if you keep these tips in mind when writing your next article on LinkedIn (or anywhere else); then hopefully it will become easier over time!"
364,92,The logistics manager and the customer service rep resolved the delivery issue because she addressed customer complaints.,customer service rep,she," logistics manager. This sentence makes sense as it would be logical that if there was a problem; then someone would address those issues or concerns from customers in order resolve them as quickly possible so they don’t continue happening again later on down road which could lead into bigger problems such as losing business due lack of satisfaction among clients who feel like their needs aren’t being taken care off properly by company representatives such themselves

### 21. Which sentence contains a misplaced modifier?"
365,92,The customer service rep and the logistics manager resolved the delivery issue because she addressed customer complaints.,customer service rep,she," Customer Service Rep.

The reason why it's her; not him; in that sentence is that it's her job as part of her job description as part of her role in the company as part of what they do as part of what they are there for in their position in the organization in relation to what it means in terms of how it works in relation to how it fits into everything else within its context within its framework within its structure within its system within its environment within its culture"
366,92,The customer service rep and the logistics manager resolved the delivery issue because he addressed customer complaints.,logistics manager,he," logistics manager. This makes sense; as it was his job as part of the management team; so we can assume that they were able to resolve the problem by working together on their own initiative without having been told what to do by anyone else in charge at their company (the CEO).

369,93,The line inspector and the quality assurance manager reviewed production quality because she found a defect.,line inspector,she," Quality Assurance Manager.

The reason for this is that it was mentioned in the previous sentence; “The Line Inspector inspected 10% of all products produced by his team.” This means he did not find any problems or issues during his inspection which would mean he would be less likely than someone else on his team who did find something wrong such as another employee who works under him like maybe even another Line Inspector? So it makes sense then why they say “she” instead"

371,93,The quality assurance manager and the line inspector reviewed production quality because he found a defect.,quality assurance manager,he," Quality Assurance Manager. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in context; as it would be unlikely that the Line Inspector would find a defect; as they are not responsible for checking product quality; but rather ensuring products are produced at high speed on assembly lines.

## What does ""them"" refer to in these sentences?

Them refers back to something or someone mentioned earlier in the sentence or paragraph. For example; if you say “I saw them at"
372,94,The research fellow and the lab assistant compiled the experiment data because she set up the apparatus.,lab assistant,she," research fellow. This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely for someone else other than her would setup the equipment in order to compile it later on.

373,94,The lab assistant and the research fellow compiled the experiment data because she set up the apparatus.,lab assistant,she," lab assistant.

This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely that someone else would know how to setup the equipment in order to compile the information from it; therefore it must be someone who has knowledge of how it works; which in turn means it must be someone involved in setting it up which means it has to be him (the researcher).

This makes sense as you are trying to explain why you did something (like go home early) rather than just stating what happened"
379,95,The civil engineer and the project estimator calculated the costs because he reviewed the blueprints.,civil engineer,he," Civil Engineer.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for him as a civil engineer; who would know how much it will cost; to review the plans; rather than someone who does not know about construction or engineering at all. A doctor was called by his patient after hours when there was no one else around but him in order to get some advice on what might happen if they were going through chemotherapy treatment again; however; instead of answering her question directly (which could"
380,96,The mechanical engineer and the tool designer refined the prototype because she tested the new design.,tool designer,she," tool designer. This sentence makes sense if you assume that it was the tool designer who was testing the new designs; not the mechanical engineers.

##### 1 Answer

See below...

#### Explanation:

The answer choices are all singular; so we need to find which of them refers back to ""she"" in each sentence; which will be our subject of choice (because it's singular). Let's go through each one!

A)"
381,96,The tool designer and the mechanical engineer refined the prototype because she tested the new design.,tool designer,she," Tool Designer. This is due to the fact that it would be easier for her; as opposed to him; to test out the new designs since it would make sense if it was her job as opposed to his job as well.

The project manager reviewed her proposal with her team members after they arrived at work today. This sentence refers to project managers who are women since it says her instead of him or he or him or her which could mean either gender but since it says “her”"
382,96,The tool designer and the mechanical engineer refined the prototype because he tested the new design.,mechanical engineer,he," tool designer.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for one person (the tool designer) to test the new design than two people (the tool designer and the mechanical engineer). 23. When I saw my friend at the mall; I asked him if we could go out on Friday night. He said yes! Who asked who? My friend asked me. 10 10 points 5 points Question 4 of 4 Question 4 of "
383,96,The mechanical engineer and the tool designer refined the prototype because he tested the new design.,mechanical engineer,he," tool designer. This is due to the fact that it would be unlikely that both of them would test it; but rather one person; most probably; the person who designed it in the first place (the tool designer).

384,97,The cybersecurity specialist and the network administrator secured the system because she updated the firewall.,network administrator,she," Cyber Security Specialist. This is due to the fact that it makes sense in terms of logic; as it would be unlikely that the Network Administrator would update the Firewall on their own without any assistance from another person or group within their organization or company they work at (such as IT).

### What are some common mistakes people make when using relative clauses?

There are many common mistakes people make when using relative clauses. One mistake people often do not realize they’"
385,97,The network administrator and the cybersecurity specialist secured the system because she updated the firewall.,network administrator,she," Network Administrator.

The reason for this is that it’s most likely that they would update the firewall; as it would be part of their job description; whereas it would not necessarily fall under the job duties of the Cyber Security Specialist."
386,97,The network administrator and the cybersecurity specialist secured the system because he updated the firewall.,cybersecurity specialist,he," Cyber Security Specialist. This is due to the fact that updating the firewall requires specialized knowledge; which only the cyber security expert would possess; making him or her most likely responsible for updating it.

## What are some of your favorite things about working at your company?

The following are some examples of questions you may be asked during your interview process: What do you like best about working here? What do you like least about it here? Why did you choose us over other"
387,97,The cybersecurity specialist and the network administrator secured the system because he updated the firewall.,cybersecurity specialist,he," Cyber Security Specialist. This makes sense since it would be his job as a security expert; not as a systems admin; to update the firewall.

## 10. Which of these sentences contains an error?

389,98,The UI designer and the mobile app developer redesigned the interface because she improved user experience.,UI designer,she," mobile app developer. This is because it's unlikely that someone would improve their own work; so it's probably someone else who has done it; in which case; they would be referred to as 'she'.
12. 12. 30/01/2019 Question #4 What does 'it' refer to in each of these sentences? (A) I don’t know if I’ll be able to go on holiday next year but"
390,98,The UI designer and the mobile app developer redesigned the interface because he improved user experience.,mobile app developer,he," Mobile App Developer.

The reason for this is that it would be easier for one person (the mobile application developer) than two people (the UX designer and the application developer). A UX Designer; Product Manager; and Engineer were working on new features when they discovered something unexpected about their product’s performance in testing sessions – it was performing much better than expected! They decided not only would these new changes help them reach their goals faster but also save money by reducing costs"
391,98,The mobile app developer and the UI designer redesigned the interface because he improved user experience.,mobile app developer,he," Mobile App Developer.

The reason why it refers to the mobile application developer; not the UX/UI Designer; is that it was his job as part of his role as part of his role in improving the UX/UI design process by improving it by improving it by making improvements in improving it by making improvements in improving it by improvements in improving it by improvements in improving it by improvements in improving it by improvements in improving it by improvements in improving it by improvements in improving it"
