5,2,The server and the chef spoke before the shift since she was running late due to traffic.,server,"## Answer (0)

The pronoun is referring to the chef.

The sentence is a bit confusing because the pronoun ""she"" is used twice, but it is referring to two different people.

The first ""she"" is referring to the chef, and the second ""she"" is referring to the server.

The sentence is saying that the chef was running late due to traffic, and the server spoke to the chef before the shift.

The pronoun is referring to the accountant.

The sentence is a bit confusing because it uses the word ""because"" twice. The first ""because"" is part of the phrase ""because she had an important message before the meeting"". The second ""because"" is part of the phrase ""because the accountant is more likely to have received a call with a message before the meeting"".

The first ""because"" is part of the reason why"
362,91,The social media coordinator and the digital marketer launched the campaign because he tracked online engagement.,digital marketer,"## Answer (0)

The answer is ""the accountant"".

The sentence is a bit confusing because it is not clear what the pronoun ""she"" refers to. The sentence could be rewritten as:
